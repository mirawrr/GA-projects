Rancilio as first machine?,"Hi yall

I'm thinking about buying my first espresso machine and a grinder to go with it. I've worked at a coffee shop for a few years and have some experience with higher end machines such as nuova simonelli victoria arduino (the type that weighs every single shot with a scale under each group head and has all the bells and whistles) But now I want one for home.

I was thinking of getting the iconic duo of Rancilia Silvia and Rocky.
I'm also wondering if I should go bigger and get a machine that can do milk and espresso at the same time as I'm used to those kinds of comfort.

Do you guys have any experience with these?
Is the Rocky a good grinder? 
Should I give in and go for a double boiler as I'm used to a lot of comforts in my espresso drink making?","Rancilio as first machine? Hi yall

How much flavour freshly ground coffee lose in a closed jar?,"So, long story short i got my new aeropress go, i finały changed to smaller option so i can drink my coffee at work. There is one small issue, i don't necessarily want to cary my K-plus all the time, it's pretty big and buying smaller is no option. 

The idea is, I'll gringo coffee to a hermetically closed jar and take it to work, it will last me one or 2 day and will be ground night before or straight ahead of work in the morning. How much flavour do i loose with that?

1zpresso JX for French press and cold brew,"I’m buying a hand grinder and I’m most strongly considering the JX.  I was just wondering what people’s experiences or thoughts were on how it handles coarser grinds.

How worried should I be about fines?  Would another grinder in the same range (can go slightly more expensive) be recommended for what I need?

Experiences/suggestions for upgrading to SSP burrs in filter grinders?,"Hello,

I'm interested in getting a broad picture of how an upgrade to SSP burrs fares with different filter focused grinders. I know that the SSP burrs are really good and that they generally will perform really well but I've also heard that there can be problems from a usability perspective.

For example: Watching James Hoffmann's video on upgrading burrs, he mentions that putting SSP burrs into a Wilfa Uniform will result in really good coffee but the grinder will sometimes start changing its grind setting while grinding if one doesn't check it. He also mentions that putting SSP burrs into an Ode and grinding finer than the stock burrs are able to will put additional strain on the motor, because it's not what it's made for.

Do you have other experiences or suggestions with these or other grinders relating to putting SSP burrs into a filter focused grinder that you could share?

Coffee beans on a budget,"I’ve always been an easy, pre-ground coffee guy, but I just got a Moccamaster and would like to get the most out of it. I know everyone is going to recommend it, but I’m not sure if I can consistently afford buying $15+ 12 oz. bags of coffee beans from my local coffee roasters. 

So my question is, if I’m buying larger quantities of whole bean coffee from the grocery store/online and grinding at home before each brew, is it exponentially better than the buying pre-ground coffee? Trying to gauge if it’s even worth it buying cheaper beans or if I should just be shelling out the extra $ for local roasters or subscription if there’s not much of a difference between cheaper beans and pre-ground. 

Also, if anyone has some good value options for whole beans in-store or even a trusted online seller, I would greatly appreciate it!","Coffee beans on a budget I’ve always been an easy, pre-ground coffee guy, but I just got a Moccamaster and would like to get the most out of it.

Advice sought: one grind setting makes pull too fast; the next grind setting makes pull (way) too slow. What do?,"Hi all, 

I recently bought the Breville Barista Express; it is my first espresso machine, so I've been learning a lot. 

Probably the most frustrating experience so far has been trying to dial in my shots. I keep coming up against the same problem: I'll pull a shot using 16g on grind size 11, burr size 4, and will pull 32g of coffee in about 15 seconds. Okay, that's a little quick, so let's adjust the grind size to be more fine, going from 11 down just to 10. Now when I pull a shot, again using 16g, barely anything comes out. Why does adjusting the grind setting by a single level go from too fast to barely functional? 

Each time I use a scale; I use a dose cup to aerate the grounds; I use a distributor, and an adjustable-depth hand-tamper that I keep the same every time. I would appreciate any help/explanations anyone can offer. Thanks for looking!","Advice sought: one grind setting makes pull too fast; the next grind setting makes pull (way) too slow. What do?

Budget friendly grinder for newbie,"*people who are in jameshoffmann reddit group might have seen this post over there, i found this group after posting there so please, bear with me*  
Hi,  
i am looking into getting my first hand grinder, trying to test methods and styles of coffee. I want to start saying that i am not looking to make espresso, other methods i will try to learn and use them at their best.  
I saw James' video about [best cheap grinder](https://youtu.be/QLEBfom0mhM?t=858) and rhino seems the best choice at the prince in my country of about 45euros (and also i can find ceramic burr to exchange if they get broken), after that i saw another budget-friendly grinder [the timemore c2](https://youtu.be/dn9OuRl1F3k?t=699) , which in my country is 65 euros ([i can buy normal stainless steel burr to change for 45euros and titanium ""plated"" burr for 50 euros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cReTrimWFAQ) ).  
At this point i do not know what to do, i am new in this coffee-""business"" and do not what spent too much money on a grinder ( tho i read that a good grinder is important) but on speciality beans so i can taste as many as they are .  
I read that best burrs are titanium (as commander has ) because they do not dull so fast and have a better grinding and such, next i saw stainless steel is pretty sharp at first but dulls kinda fast and ceramics is less sharp than stainless but doesnt dull that fast.  
I would love for an opinion regarding c2 vs rhino and what about those e&amp;b burrs for c2, if you know any other budget friendly (about 60 more or less euroes ) grinders, i am happy to check them out.

Switched countries (short-term) and need a new solution for my daily cup !,"Hi sub ! 

I've been a happy and satisfied owner of a Breville Barista Express for the last 2 years. I am by no means a hardcore Aficionado/pro, but I've been really enjoying having a good espresso once a day, trying different beans and settings until I get it right etc. 

Now I moved to Europe from NA and couldn't bring my breville (kept it there for when I'm back).   
In the meantime, I still want to get my daily coffee but would prefer not to buy another barista express (or similar) because 1/ I don't have as much space in my new place, 2/ I'm only here for \~ 8 months and don't want to have a hard-time reselling when it's time to go back.

So, I'm thinking about 2 options : 

1. Moka Pot / Aeropress - Pros : Cheap, great space-wise, easy to clean, gets you a tasteful black coffee. Con : Doesn't get you a ""real"" espresso. 
2. Stainless-steel reusable pod + freshly ground coffee + Coffee Pod Machine (e.g nespresso) - Pros: Would get me my a espresso, some of the machines (e.g Essenza mini) don't take much space. Cons : Probably can't bag 9g of ground coffee in the reusable pod, so unsure how the end-product would taste like and I don't know which coffee pod machine to pick (would they all be the same if I use custom pods ?).  

What would be your advice between those 2 ? Any other alternative I should consider ? If your advice is to go with second option, what machine would fit my needs best ?

Where have you tried your best coffee?,"I wonder where you have tried your best coffee or what was the best moment when you realized that the coffee is the most delightful? Many of you might share stories about your trips to Europe or other places with the best coffee. I’ve tried the best coffee in my own house.

&amp;#x200B;

When my BF and I decided to purchase a house, the story started. It wasn’t a spontaneous decision. We decided to move in together when I rented a small studio apartment. I used to live there with my 2 cats and my York terrier. I really loved that apartment, it was close to my work, and it was downtown. But, my BF started to stay over there too often, and we decided that it was time to move in. He barely needed to pack his things coz most of his stuff was already at my place.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, there wasn’t enough space for all 5 of us, especially in the evening, when my BF wanted to watch a game on TV and I had to work. We started to look for a bigger place and found a lovely house for sale. We decided to combine our savings and apply for a mortgage. But, to make everything easier with the paperwork, we went to a City Hall and got married. That was a spontaneous decision.

&amp;#x200B;

When all papers were signed, and we got the keys, we started to pack everything. I went to our new place several times to clean everything. Still, it took us 3 days to move all our stuff into a new house. I also bought a lot of stuff online and ordered shipping to my new address. My new stylish coffee press would look perfect in the modern and urban-styled black-and-grey kitchen. I’m glad that I purchased it. Because during the moving process, I accidentally dropped the water tank of my old coffee maker.

&amp;#x200B;

So, on the first morning in a new house. We slept on our new mattress without a bed frame. I woke up early in the morning, before the sunrise. I unpacked my french press and filed some water. I made some coffee, found my favorite mug, and enjoyed this delightful drink in my own house. I felt happy at that moment, and that coffee seemed the best one.","Where have you tried your best coffee?

[MOD] The Official Deal Thread,"Welcome to the /r/Coffee deal and promotional thread! In this weekly thread, industry folk can post upcoming deals or other promotions their companies are holding, or promote new products to /r/Coffee subscribers! Regular users can also post deals they come across. Come check out some of the roasters and other coffee-related businesses that Redditors work for!

Note that this thread will be weekly at least for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak, since many roasters are running more specials than usual to drum up business.

We encourage everyone to post deals here especially since many roasters are holding specials to drive business affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. However, note that there will be zero tolerance for shady behavior. If you're found to be acting dishonestly here, your posting will be removed and we will consider banning you on the spot. If you yourself are affiliated with a business, please be transparent about it.

There are a few rules for businesses posting promotional material:

- You need to be active in /r/Coffee in a non-self-promotional context to participate in this thread. If it seems you are only here to promote your business in this thread, your submissions will be removed. Build up some /r/Coffee karma first. The Official Noob-Tastic Question Fest weekly thread, posted every Friday, would be a good place to start, and check out what is on the Front Page and jump in on some discussions. Please maintain a high ratio of general /r/Coffee participation to posts in this thread.

- If you are posting in this thread representing a business, please make sure to request your industry flair from the mods before posting.

- Don't just drop a link, say something worthwhile! Start a discussion! Say something about your roasting process or the exciting new batch of beans you linked to!

- Promotions in this thread must be actual deals/specials or new products. Please don't promote the same online store with the same products week after week; there should be something interesting going on. Having generally “good prices” does not constitute a deal.

- No crowdfunding campaigns (Kickstarter, Indiegogo, etc). Do not promote a business or product that does not exist yet. Do not bait people to ask about your campaign. Do not use this thread to survey /r/Coffee members or gauge interest in a business idea you have.

- Please do not promote affiliate/referral programs here, and do not post referral links in this thread.

- This thread is not a place for private parties to sell gear. /r/coffeeswap is the place for private party gear transactions.

- Top-level comments in this thread must be listings of deals. Please do not comment asking for deals in your area or the like.

- More rules may be added as needed. If you're not sure whether or not whatever you're posting is acceptable, message the mods and ask!

Automatic Espresso Machine tips,"Hello,  
So I stumbled upon this reddit and found lots of people discussing coffee and techniques and all sorts of things like that and wanted to see if there was anything out there to help give me some input. I have stepped up and bought an espresso machine. I purchased the Philips 3200 Lattego machine last week and I am absolutely loving it so far. I am newer to this part of the coffee brewing. I have had my own grinder and buying whole beans but still nothing fancy and I was just using a Keurig to brew coffee every morning at home. I have started drinking a lot of milk drinks so I went with an upgrade.

I was wondering if there are any pointers, tips, techniques, things to look for, etc. that would help make this experience even better. I know it is an automatic machine and sometimes limited to what I can do but just wanted to make sure I am doing things right to get the most out of it. Thanks!","Automatic Espresso Machine tips Hello,

Has my shop ground the beans to fine?,"I’m relatively new to pouring a shot, so to remove the many variables involved I purchased the beans pre-ground.

For the grind, the shop offers lots of options like, “filter”, “cafetière” and “espresso”. My first couple of bags have been espresso.

I’m pretty confident I’ve gotten the tamper weight mostly right by now.. barring the odd failure.

But this most recent bag, also a new type of bean than usual, it’s impossible not to pack it too tight… to be honest my machine is struggling to create enough pressure to pour. I’m not a complete novice. But I’m surprised how hard it is to get the tamper right.

Has my shop ground this too fine? Could the new bean be something I just need adjust for? 

I’m wondering whether to complain, because it’s likely an honest mistake, or just take business elsewhere.","Has my shop ground the beans to fine? I’m relatively new to pouring a shot, so to remove the many variables involved I purchased the beans pre-ground.

My Rocket Giotto is curdling my milk,"Here’s the background. I got the machine about 3 months ago. It’s been perfect. I love it like a child.

I use a Eureka grinder.

I ran out of beans yesterday so I replaced them with some relatively fresh beans from a local roaster.

The first shot I pulled was no good, over extracted and slow. I adjusted the grind to be more coarse.

The second shot was good.

I steamed the milk and that was all normal. When I added it to the espresso, it curdled immediately.

I tried another shot, same thing.

I ran a cleaning cycle with cleaning tabs, flushed it with water, and left the machine over night.

This morning I had the same issue with the curdling milk.

I swapped the beans, same issue.

Tried different milk, same issue. (2% and 1% A2 milk, fresh).

Flushed the machine through the steam wand, hot water wand, and group head, probably 4L worth of water. No change.

I tested the steam only and hot water wand into milk and there is no curdling. I tested hot water from the group head and there is no curdling.

I tested two different portafilters and there is no difference.

I added 2 types of cold (undreamed) milk to an espresso shot and got curdling.

So it seems like something with the group head and espresso that is causing the curdling. Also of note, the pucks of espresso are more wet and have water sitting on top when I remove the porta filter from the group head. Not a lot, but it’s different than what I’m used to seeing. What I am used to seeing is a relatively clean/dry puck.

I am puzzled.","My Rocket Giotto is curdling my milk Here’s the background. I got the machine about 3 months ago. It’s been perfect. I love it like a child.

Recommendations in general,"Good evenin' ladies and gentlebaristas.

Having a few to no answers on my post in r/espresso, I am asking my questions here.
For the sake of this subreddit. I would plan, If I buy an espresso machine, to buy something like the Aeropress or a Chemex for larger, normal coffees? Any Tips about that?

I am from germany, a 19 year old Soldier and i am currently growing my love for coffee. 
I love good cappuccino or latte macchiato, but also black coffee, but only made from good machines (my dads jura makes some good tasting stuff)

Now, I wanna get into the espresso making, or firstly, espresso making. I never really tasted good espresso since no one I know has a good machine (does a jura s8 produce good espresso? not livin at my dads anymore...).

I need recommendations how to get to know if I like espresso and also an idea for a maybe-to-be espresso setup.

I've been looking at portable espresso makers for a few weeks since i need to get it home weekends.

My ideas: 

1. 9Barista. I LOVE the look and I am alone in drinking coffee, almost never will i need to pull multiple shots and it looks quite simple to handle

2. Flair machines in general. I think they look really cool and especially the 58 has some style to it, also making temperature handling easier, but they are not as portable and take more variables to be controlled and more cleaning, maybe more fussy.

3. The Robot. I don't quite like the design and don't know much about how many variables are to be controlled, how much cleaning and stuff is needed, please tell me more

4. The Rok, also I don't know much about it, please give me the same info as to the robot.

Okay, that was it for the beginning, I appreciate any help and wish you guys tasty shots and a good weekend!","Recommendations in general Good evenin' ladies and gentlebaristas.

"The best temperature for immersion brewing, and why?","I'm pretty new to making coffee at home, since I've always been working places with free decent coffee. Starting an office job and now I'm getting really into it as a hobby.

I ordered some coffee that's a little darker than is ideal (for me) by mistake. It's roasted for espresso rather than filter and (despite how much I want one) I don't own an espresso machine, so I've been making do with my french press and recently my Clever dripper. It's still not THAT dark but it is on the darker end of medium and I've been getting a lot of harshness from it and a real astringent aftertaste no matter how I grind. At first I was brewing with boiling water, thinking that if it was too harsh I could grind coarser to extract less, but even grinding very coarse I still get that bitterness. Out of curiosity I tried adding cool water to my kettle just until the water wasn't boiling anymore and brewed with that, and it was SO much better. I got those caramelised flavours so much more clearly while still keeping those acidic berry notes and no harsh aftertaste. Even in a french press with a rather long steep time and no paper filter, the lower temperature made it taste so much less extracted and more balanced.

My question is: why? Why does it make such a big difference? I've watched the James Hoffmann video about brewing temperature (of course) and I've read what I can find about this and there seems to be a consensus that darker roasts favour lower temperatures. But as I understand it, for an immersion brew with a long steep time, the only thing temperature should affect is how fast you extract what is available from the grounds? I would expect that a 100°C brew and a 95°C brew left immersed for 15 minutes would both be about the same extraction level with the same grind size, and yet the results taste totally different. The only way I can think to explain it is that it has something to do with the evenness of my grind (which isn't great, but isn't terrible either - I'm using a 1zpresso JX-pro).

Has anyone else had the same experience? Do you know what could scientifically explain these results? I'm happy to be drinking really great coffee but I'm kind of annoyed that I don't understand exactly what makes it so much better.","The best temperature for immersion brewing, and why?

Question about intensity,"Hello,

I usually buy my Brasil at a local roaster, and I'm very happy with it, I use it in drip coffee or the occasional espresso.

I weight 30gram for half a liter of water for drip coffee and it comes out just how I like it. Up until around a month or two, where I had to use around 40 grams for the same water volume.

I bought some other (cheap) coffee to see if it could be my grinder having problems but it seems it is not.

Can a bean just lose like a third of its ""taste"" just like that? Have my roaster changed beans? It seems like the roast is okay and it's persistent too over at least some weeks.

A Happy Mug Cautionary Tale,"A couple of weeks ago, I ordered $179 worth of coffee from Happy Mug.  Fedex said they delivered it and it the package never showed.  I reached out to Happy Mug and they suggested that I should raise the issue with paypal and that paypal would refund my money, which wouldn't make Happy Mug lose money.   I followed their instructions and Paypal reached out to Happy Mug.   Happy Mug sent fedex tracking info to Paypal and Paypal closed my claim; it can't be reopened.   Then Happy Mug reached out to Fedex and told me Fedex may reimburse me.   Of course, Fedex declined their claim because from their records they delivered the package.  

In the end, Happy Mug guarantees satisfaction, but only if the remedies are at the expense of Paypal or FedEx.  I've concluded that unfortunately I should be spending my money with bigger companies.  It's easy for Happy Mug to not require signatures on their shipments since, in the end, they're not actually taking any risk.  They put the risk of that decision on their customers.   

They're good people with good coffee, but a risky choice for a buyer.  I waited to post this to see how it would all work out.","A Happy Mug Cautionary Tale A couple of weeks ago, I ordered $179 worth of coffee from Happy Mug.

Not sure what roast to get for a cold brew concentrate,"Howdy! So summer has finally arrived in my area, and I’m interested in trying to make a refreshing cold drink, particularly one that would be perfect for get togethers. But, right now, I’m in a state of analysis paralysis and don’t even have a clue as to what coffee to use as my base.

Here’s all I’m looking for to start: a decaf roast, perfect to make a cold brew concentrate out of, that contains notes of berry, chocolate and nut.

Right now I’m considering the [chocolate raspberry decaf from Stone Street](https://stonestreetcoffee.com/products/chocolate-raspberry-decaf?currency=USD&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwm6KUBhC3ARIsACIwxBi5SOuvGYFqcS33-SUnIJc3Y4jkUtverczWPRHPYASmgMxtOTXWgXsaAsgOEALw_wcB&amp;variant=39679171559589) and the [decaf Ethiopia Worka Chelbesa natural from Onyx Coffee Lab](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/products/decaf-ethiopia-worka-chelbesa-natural), but…

1) I’m not sure if either would be suitable to make a cold brew concentrate with,

2) as on the nose as the chocolate raspberry decaf seems, the smallest amount they offer is 1 pound, and if I just want to sample it first, I don’t wanna be restricted to a pound if I end up not liking it, and

3) the roast from Onyx would be pretty pricy imo for a batch brew.

So, what do ya think? Any coffee suggestions? Any thoughts on the two roasts I’m currently considering? (And for bonus points, any drink ideas that you fancy that could give me some inspiration?)

(Also, side note, I definitely don’t know as much about coffee as others in this sub, so apologies if anything doesn’t make too much sense or sounds a lil strange.)","Not sure what roast to get for a cold brew concentrate Howdy!

"I drink too much coffee, should I worry?","Hi everyone, I’m not really new to coffee, I’m 25 and been drinking coffee for 11 years.
I’ve been smoking cigarettes for even longer, but my question is about coffee (cause I know smoking kills)

So I been drinking coffee a lot.
I got on and off moments, but when I drink coffee I don’t joke.

On a working/typical day: I drink like 9 espresso (maybe more at times)

On weekends or non working days I tend to not drink any coffee
But if I’m seem fat in my mirror, then I’d have like 3-4 espressos around noon and maybe 2-3 more around 5pm (that coffee is drank instead of eating an unhealthy or healthy meal)

And yes I’m very jittery 😬 
I’m a shaker that shakes on its own in the vacuum of space and time.
(Also got ADHD, if it wasn’t natural all that stimulation probably did it)

So since I’ve quit drinking alcohol I’ve been thinking of quitting smoking and coffee also, but uncertain about those last two, they’ve been part of my life for too long..
I feel great, but people are like « bruv it’s unhealthy you worry us, also u seem always cold.. »","I drink too much coffee, should I worry? Hi everyone, I’m not really new to coffee, I’m 25 and been drinking coffee for 11 years.

Talking state of the art in cold coffee,"Summer is approaching and I think we all need some refreshing iced drinks. I've been a coffee enthusiast for many years now but one thing I haven't touched in about 2 years is cold coffee. I'm not sure what is the current best option to get a good extraction in a cold coffee.   
Back 2 years ago it was using lots of coffee (like a 1:10 ratio) with room temp water for &gt;24h, coarsely ground to get some cold brew.  
Nowadays we know much more about how coffee extracts (or at least I know more than then), and that method does not sound viable at all, especially for light roasts. Cold water would probably have no way of extracting a ratio like 1:10 (too much bean for the water to handle).  Also why use a coarse grind? You can always filter your coffee later and you should make up for the cooler temp somehow, why not go super fine?  
As such, what is the best way to get a great cup of iced coffee? Can you achieve good extraction just through the standard cold brew immersion? (maybe by using a more realistic ratio like 1:16). Do the other options have a better chance to yield good coffee? Japanese style iced coffee? Maybe the cold drip?   
I know specialty coffee shops in my area use both cold brew and cold drip...  
What do you guys use?","Talking state of the art in cold coffee Summer is approaching and I think we all need some refreshing iced drinks.

No longer feeling the caffeine boost. Have I become tolerant?,"To keep it short and sweet, for the past two weeks, I’ve been guzzling my regular V60 black from my own UK favourites such as WatchHouse, Starbucks Blends and a Lidl Sumatran Blend, arguably all strong roasts and have always been my morning blends. I’ve even dusted off the Nespresso machine and been using Cafepod Supercharger Espresso, sometimes even two shots if I fancy it, be it in iced form or a faux flat white.

Usually, the caffeine will course through my system very quickly and within five minutes, the grogginess gone and my brain alert (I have ADHD so use that as a measure). Ofcourse, as the title suggests all of this has vanished. Now the biggest caveat here is what has changed is that I have acquired a very active, very nocturnal six-week old kitten who sleeps an hour on and then off. My usual 8-9 hour slumber is now broken into one hour segments so I never have my usual deep REM sleep. It’s coincidental that my tolerance to coffee has also changed during this period.

Is it possible that my body is now saying “nope, get some actual sleep now because this coffee isn’t going to help”?

Advice appreciated because although you may not have a kitten, I’m sure there are many parents on this sub who can share my pain somewhat.","No longer feeling the caffeine boost.

Looking for alternatives to Bunn My Cafe MCU,"I recently got a bit more money/budget for this. I was going to buy the Bunn My Cafe MCU but I have some minor grievances with it. Wondering if there's another alternative with these nice-haves:

1. Buttons to dial in Small/Med/Large quantities
2. Bigger back reservoir (I'd love something about double the size but no bigger)
3. Different speed/brew options (I know it has pulse but some more options would be cool)
4. Programmable/with API (doubt this exists but asking in case...)

Must take in paper pods AND grounds with minimum hassle. This is why the Bunn My Cafe even got my attention, very pleased with the design letting you operate differently. K-cup compatibility is a bonus but I don't need it.

Timemore Slim Plus cleaning issues,"After watching a couple videos of how to disassemble and clean the Chestnut Slim, I tried it for myself.

Of course I had already removed the dial, inner burr, spring and even a small ring that goes on top of the spring.

Troubles with 3D latte art either not stiff enough or stiff enough but too airey?,"I'm trying to do 3D latte art and using skim milk with a Breville Bambino.

It seems I either end up with:

1) Milk foam that is not stiff enough so it just loses it structure very quickly. It's closer to a microfoam than macrofoam. However, at least it doesn't start to become ""airey"" and air pockets don't start forming when I draw on it with liquid chocolate.

2) Milk foam that is stiff enough, closer to a macrofoam. I can make good structures but once I start drawing on it with the liquid chocolate, air bubbles start to pop. Kind of like [this](https://i.redd.it/4b0jdvpyev071.jpg).

Is it because I am using skim milk? Or frothing incorrectly? I typically just adjust the amount of space between the milk and frothing wand to either increase or decrease the stiffness. Or maybe I just need to make a stiff foam by keeping the wand high from the surface of the milk but then spend more time incorporating?","Troubles with 3D latte art either not stiff enough or stiff enough but too airey?

Wording related to a specific flavour profile,"I enjoy a specific flavour of coffee, but I'm having a hell of a time navigating the 'tasting notes' from various roasters.

The best bag I've ever gotten was from PNG roasted by Coffee Supreme. It had an intense boozy-fruity aroma, which carried on into the coffee. Of course when I went back to the shop I got it from, they said that it was unpopular and didn't get anymore. 

The commonality between the beans I've have that had this were they were natural (but not all?), and apparently lightly roasted as they were harder to grind? I've had most success from Ethiopia, but as I've said the best was from PNG, I got some from Mexico and Brazil which were great as well. 

Beans either have this aroma and flavour (to varying strengths) or they don't which makes it all the more frustrating when I see notes that appear to have what I want, but it doesn't tick the box.

I was hoping I might get some guidance on specifically what flavour I seem to have honed in on, and where I might look to find more. Specific suggestions of beans within Canada (or North America at this point) would be greatly appreciated!","Wording related to a specific flavour profile I enjoy a specific flavour of coffee, but I'm having a hell of a time navigating the 'tasting notes' from various roasters.

Okay I Ve Made My Espresso Now What Do I Do With The Milk?,"I did all of the things to make an espresso at home. I bought myself a good espresso machine. I learned which espresso beans have the best taste and how to grind them to the correct fineness. I managed to insert the gadget with the grinds, known as a portafilter, into the espresso machine, lock it into place, turn on the machine and let her rip. Great espresso!

But I wanted a cappuccino. Sue wanted a latte. Time to figure out how to steam the milk.

Sue is always dieting, so she wants nonfat milk. I found out that low fat and nonfat milk foam really easily. Whole milk takes more practice. Same thing with half and half if you want a breve.

Some espresso machines have a built in steam nozzle and some don’t. You may need to buy a separate steamer. I recommend getting an espresso machine with one built in. Saves space.

The first thing to do is to put that stainless steel pitcher and milk into the refrigerator to get cold. Always start with them cold. And then my next learning curve came with remembering to fill the pitcher about a third to a half full. Milk expands really well when it’s steamed. It takes only once for it to foam up, overflow and hit the floor to remember to start with a pitcher no more than half full.

Start by putting the nozzle on the surface of the milk and turning the steam on full. The milk is going to begin to foam, so keep lowering the pitcher so that the nozzle is just under the surface of the milk. About a half inch will do fine. You can turn down the pressure when the foam really begins to rise, or just take the pitcher away. Now the milk is just about at the boiling point.

Now here is something important. Don’t let it boil. This is another way to get the milk to overflow the pitcher. Or even worse, it will taste burnt. Ugh. Nasty.

Your steamed milk should have little bubbles all the way through it, and there should be a light foam on the top. There you are. That’s it. Now you go make whatever espresso drink you want. Happy coffee:)","Okay I Ve Made My Espresso Now What Do I Do With The Milk? I did all of the things to make an espresso at home. I bought myself a good espresso machine.

Sage Barista Pro (SES878BSS),"Hi all,

I’ve had a Sage machine (as per the title) which had a faulty heater after 8 months. It’s taken 7 weeks (weekly phone calls to Sage and Coffee Classics and emails) to finally get a replacement machine.

Anyway long story short, old one settings noted and then boxed up to return, new one setup, same settings, same coffee beans, same model. Grinds terribly and then it doesn’t pour out of the portafilter. Anyway after lots of coffee setting amendments and gone through 500g of coffee and bunch of milk, I decided to look at it logically. What is going wrong where. Okay so the water isn’t extracting out of the portafilter (most of the time no water), tested without the PF in it, works fine. So water is fine, tested PF without coffee and just water, come out fine. Coffee is the issue, what’s different? Same company beans and the grind was a lot slower, so where it usually would take 9 seconds to grind into the PF, it took 18-26 seconds on the setting we used to have. Odd. So I unboxed the old machine and checked both grinders, completely different.

Tested the old machine to grind the beans and then use new machine to extract and it worked as expected!

Anyone explain why the same coffee machine model, less than a year apart have different grinders? The old one was a lot more protruded (stood out a lot more) - new one, both outside and inside burr were a lot more flat, which was causing the grinder to not grind the beans very well, clumpy.

But I can’t understand why they are so different?

I’ll upload a pic of the differences. Raised a ticket to sage to complain too but their service is terrible.

Coffee grind size for SCA cupping using Comandante and Kruve sifter,"Well I was wondering to do some cuppings recently. The grind size as always may be the most important factor to consider. So I started to calibrate my Comandante MK4 using the Kruve sifter.
Kruve recommends that grind sizes to be from 400μm to 1200μm. So I started grinding 8 grams of beans with 30 clicks away (CCW) from the zero setting of the Comandante.The result wasn't very satisfying and lots of coarser grounds remained in the upper chamber of the Kruve sifter. Below you can find my best results. Also note that my coffee beans are a medium roast blend from a local roastery.

Comandante setting: 22 clicks
8 gr of beans
0.75 gr waste (mostly coarser than 1200μm grounds)

Comandante setting: 20 clicks
8 gr of beans
0.57 gr waste (mostly finer than 400μm grounds)

Comandante setting: 19 
8 gr of beans
0.48 gr watse (almost only finer than 400μm grounds)


So you can adjust your Comandante grinder somewhere between 19 to 22 depending on your bean roast profile.

Burr Grinders Seem to Produce a lot of Coffee!,"Recently I decided to start trying to use a burr grinder after working with an electric grinder for many years.

I don't know whether my espresso machine is at fault or if I just need a better grinder.,"Hi, this is my firstly post here. I recently bought a used espresso machine (a local Korean brand named Boral), which is classified here as a ""semi-automatic"" coffee machine. It has a small pressure gauge. For my grinder, I'm using a Baratza Maestro (Plus?), which I had calibrated to the finer setting, and the finest I can get my grind ⠀to can be seen from this image: https://imgur.com/a/uWNd9VO The problem I have is with how the machine is extracting way too quickly (12\~15 seconds for a 1:2 ratio). Fresh beans and old beans same story. And so I imagined, from several google search results, that my grind is probably too coarse. And so, going against some people's advice, I tried using a food processor (blender) to get it finer and finer. The coffee became extra fine and the coffee machine started to choke (the pressure gauge with the Baratza grind only goes up to 5\~7 bars of pressure while going over 10 with the finer grind), with a minimum of 25 seconds of brew time and some going over 1 minute for a 1:2 ratio. But I've watched a few videos online and it seemed as if the grind they were using weren't much finer than what my Baratza grinder was putting out. And so finally the question I have is, is my grinder simply not enough? Or is it my espresso machine? (As in, would other espresso machines have good brew times with the type of grind I'm getting from my grinder). Thank you.","I don't know whether my espresso machine is at fault or if I just need a better grinder. Hi, this is my firstly post here.

How much does it cost to start a cafe?,"I often daydream about opening a cafe, but I know it's an expensive affair. But just for laughs, I thought I'd try writing down some of the costs, and ask you for help filling in blanks.

What other considerations are there?

automatic coffee machine for office,"Hi everybody, I've been told that my office is getting a new coffee machine as the one we already had was pretty broken.

Our previous machine was actually pretty cool, it had beans in the top, and was basically a full stack espresso brewer (poorly tuned as of the last couple times it was broken), it would grind, press and pull on a per cup basis which was pretty cool

aeropress: coffee is flowing out the edges of paper filter.,"hi there -- I am not talking about normal filtration dripping through the filter (I know you can brew upside down if the speed of that bothers you -- it doesn't bother me). 

instead it is flowing straight through the filter in a circular pattern around the circumference of the plastic cap. coffee is like mud, naturally.

I bought the aeropress last week. three times it brewed normally ... coffee was fine with great clarity. 

I thought maybe I got a few dud filters that were too small so I tried it three more times and it kept happening.

I read that you could use a regular coffee filter by laying a square over the perforated cap, tightening the cap and then trimming the extra paper so I tried that. 

same thing happened again. 

I really can't think what could be wrong apart from maybe there is an imperceptible hairline crack? 

because the parts and procedure seem idiot proof. 

I should note I am using very finely powdered coffee and the first three times it was very hard to plunge no matter how slowly I did it  (but I didn't hear a crack). 

not sure what to do at this point aside from trying more filters and maybe replacing the brown perforated cap.

suggestions would be great! thanks","aeropress: coffee is flowing out the edges of paper filter. hi there -- I am not talking about normal filtration dripping through the filter (I know you can brew upside down if the speed of that bothers you -- it doesn't bother me).

"Non-dairy, sugar free creamer that actually lightens coffee?","Non-powdered!

I'm really trying to eliminate dairy and sugar from my diet completely. 

I cannot find any non-dairy milk that actually lightens the coffee like a fairy creamer does.

I've tried the following..

Coconut milk - the worst, watery, very flat and barely lightens

Almond milk - better than coconut milk, but barely. Slightly creamier than coconut milk

Cashew milk - creamier than both almond and coconut. Lightens better than almond, slightly.

Oat milk - can froth well...I like the texture best of all the above but doesn't lighten well at all

Nut pods (almond coconut) lightens better than all but nowhere near as good as fairy...tastes good

Barista express low pressure all of a sudden," Hi,

I have had the Sage (Breville outside England) Barista Express for around 4 months now and have been until today very happy with it and the coffee it makes.

Like every morning, today, I made my wife and myself a coffee. The first coffee came out fine with a good pressure reading (around midway). I did exactly the same process the second time but the pressure didn't even make it to the espresso range, just reaching pre-infusion levels. I tried this another 3 times including by changing the grind to the most fine level possible but nothing was able to get the pressure to espresso range.

Why is this happening and how come this happened all of a sudden?

Thanks in advance.","Barista express low pressure all of a sudden  Hi,

Issues with a new Niche Zero (Jan 2022 build date),"I just recently received a brand new Niche Zero with a Jan 2022 build date about two days ago.  I was able to run four 40g doses through it without any issues but on the fifth time using it, it would no longer dispense coffee.

After cleaning according to the instructions, I found that the bottom blade was catching either on the walls of the grinder or on the axle.  The tolerances are as such that I can't really tell where the snag is. 

I am also unable to remove the blade at all -- I can get it to rise about a centimeter or so up the axle but then the blade will bind again. 

I lowered the blade and it appears to spin freely when seated on the bottom of the grinder, but when I grind, it will only dispense about 8 grams and then no longer dispenses.  The conical burr will rotate but it's the bottom blade that is snagging. 

I'm not grinding any beans that are dark roasted or oily -- they are medium roasted hard African beans.  

I performed this operation about three times with the same results and sent an email to Niche about it.  

I'm wondering if anyone with the same build date has had similar issues -- perhaps an issue with the milling of the blade or the axle perhaps?","Issues with a new Niche Zero (Jan 2022 build date) I just recently received a brand new Niche Zero with a Jan 2022 build date about two days ago.

"French press coffee - acidity and weakness, question about ratios and preparation","I'm currently getting more into preparing myself a nice cup of french press coffee.

* Timemore C2 Grinder
* Grønenberg stainless steel french press
* water hardness around 8° dH/235 ppm

 

Preparation:

* 12-13 grams of beans, grind on 22 clicks
* Kettle on 95°c (203°F) 
* In: \~230ml of water in the french press
* Short bloom, then \~4 minutes of brewing time, stirring once or twice, not pressing the grounds, inspired by hoffmann method
* Out: \~210ml of coffee in the cup

&amp;#x200B;

I still think there might be a little too much acidity and a slightly weaker arrival than I would like, and from pourover I know these beans can deliver a bit more. I'm not sure how to adjust though, I already reduced the bean dosage and changed the grind setting (I started at 25 clicks).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm grateful for any pointers, are my ratios maybe completely off or what else could I adjust to look for improvements?

"Looking for a new grinder, could use some advice","I'm looking for a new grinder. Specifically, I'm looking to switch from a hand grinder to an electric grinder. I'll try to give you guys as much information on my current grinding and brewing:

I currently own an 1Zpresso JX Pro hand grinder. I'm quite happy with it as it produces vastly better distributions than the cheap Hario grinder I used before and because it's easy to use. I opted for a hand grinder because it's better value for money in terms of grinding performance and I didn't know yet how far I was going to go with my ""coffee game"". I only make filter coffee at the moment.

There are two reasons why I wish to buy a new grinder that is electric:

1) As I use my grinder that much and I expect to be grinding more often for more than one cup at a time, the convenience of an electric grinder is something I'd value greatly.

2) While I know that my current grinder is pretty good, there's room to grow. So as my experience and ""brewing skills"" grow, I thought I'd make an investment into my hobby by buying a good electric grinder that could last me for a bit.

A couple of things that may be relevant for which grinder to choose:

- I live in Europe (Switzerland), so I can only buy what can be shipped to Germany or Switzerland and I can only use a machine with the correct voltage.

- As mentioned, I currently only make filter coffee, not espresso but I could imagine switching to espresso at some point (once I can afford it).

- Needless to say, I'd wish for an improvement in performance compared to my current grinder, so entry level electric grinders in a similar price range as my grinder would be out of the question.

- If I choose a filter focused grinder, I'd want it to be able to reliably grind fine enough. I remember Hoffmann's review of the Fellow Ode, saying that he worries that it doesn't grind fine enough for a one cup V60. My Aeropress and Moka pot are even finer than my one cup V60, so maybe a grinder that is made to be able to do espresso but able to do filter well as well would be good (?), something like the Niche.


Feel free to ask me for more clarifications.

Thanks a lot","Looking for a new grinder, could use some advice I'm looking for a new grinder. Specifically, I'm looking to switch from a hand grinder to an electric grinder. I'll try to give you guys as much information on my current grinding and brewing:

Utilizing (rather than preventing) static electricity in hand grinders to prevent fines?,"So I've been using the common setup with the C40 and the V60 for years, and one thing that always bugged me about the C40 was the way the burr would grow a ""beard"" of fines, and also lots of them sticking to the side of the jar. I solved this by releasing one drop of water in the beans before grinding them, in order to kill off all the static electricity and not waste any coffee or do extra cleaning after each use, but yesterday evening I watched [this video](https://youtu.be/l2asYfh-Apk?t=747) from European Coffee Trip (video should start at 12:27), where they say that it is actually a good idea to let the static electricity build up and avoid knocking out the fines from the grinder, so that they have less chance of adding bitterness to the cup.

I never thought about it this way, but the way he describes it does make sense. What are your thoughts about this? I tried it first time today and didn't notice any difference, but I'm curious to keep trying this method.

Need advice on how to prevent oat milk separation in drip coffee,"I have a toddler with a severe milk allergy so we are trying to cut down on having milk around the house. Oat milk seems to be a delicious alternative but I'm having trouble keeping it from separating. I've tried two brands both of them are the barista blend: Califia and Oatly.

I tried adding it at room temperature, stirring rapidly as I add it (temper), adding it cold, and just adding it regularly to my drip coffee. I would say 95% of the time it seems to separate.

Is there a good (reliable) way to measure evenness of extraction?,"I've never used one myself but from what I gather about refractometers they're used to measure the extraction of the coffee but not how even it was extracted. If I properly stir my coffee and then take a sample to inspect with the refractometer and for example calculate and extraction of 20%, the overall extraction of my coffee is about 20%, but I get no information about how evenly it was extracted. Am I wrong?
I'd maybe still be able to improve the flavor of the coffee by extracting more evenly, preventing some potential bitter or sour compounds I don't want.

Is there a way to actually measure evenness of extraction? I'm sure someone with enough experience in tasting coffee will be able to tell the difference between the same coffee, with one of the two being more evenly extracted (better grinder, immersion, better technique, etc.). But tasting is not measuring and as with extraction, it's probably most useful to combine what you think based on what you taste with a refractometer measurement to really learn what's going on.","Is there a good (reliable) way to measure evenness of extraction?

First Experience with Blue Bottle Dripper,"I recently got curious about flat-bottom drippers, and picked up the Blue Bottle dripper because it seemed to have worked out some of the quirks of the Wave and other similar units. I brewed two cups today, and thought I'd share my results! 

First cup was a medium-light Ethiopian natural I roasted at home. In the V60, I was getting pretty balanced cups but maybe a touch under extracted. In the Blue Bottle Dripper, (BBD, henceforth) as soon as I lifted the dripper off the cup I was smacked in the face by the aroma of hot sugar. (Think cotton candy.) Flavor-wise, it was what you expect from an Ethiopian natural. Jammy, aggressively floral. My favorite thing about it was the body, though. I've never had a cup of filter coffee that was so syrupy! It was pretty high strength, and veeery high extraction at ~24%. 

Second cup was a darker roasted blend I bought from a new coffee shop in the area. It's the one they brew in house for filter coffee, and I think it's a great example of a specialty dark roast! (Dark-ish, really.) I didn't measure extraction, but I was still impressed. There was a candy banana note I never tasted in my V60 or Aeropress cups, and again, much heavier body. This could be down to different filter paper, but either way, I like it! 

My personal experience with the V60 is that you usually have to trade high extraction for clarity. You can get a sweeter cup, but usually with less flavor separation than a bright cup. So far, it seems like you don't make that trade with the BBD. 

A few caveats: with only two brews down, I may find things to dislike about the dripper with time. Coming from a plastic V60, I'm nervous about dropping or breaking. Some coffees may benefit from a bit lower EY, and I don't know if that will be easy to do on the BBD. Also, it doesn't fit neatly on the glass body of my French Press, which I usually use as a server. For all that, though, I'm super stoked to explore what it can do! 

I think I pretty comprehensively covered my experience, but drop your questions/advice/experience too!","First Experience with Blue Bottle Dripper I recently got curious about flat-bottom drippers, and picked up the Blue Bottle dripper because it seemed to have worked out some of the quirks of the Wave and other similar units.

Currently, he uses a Mr. Coffee 12-cup drip coffee maker with basically no controls and very critically no auto-shutoff so he has to pull it out of the wall every morning when he goes to work.  And he makes his coffee the night before when the pot runs out and leaves Mr. Coffee running overnight, so I don't want his house to burn down.  

I think I want to get him a better one for Father's Day so:

* Auto or manual shutoff
* Scheduled ""I wake up at 4AM every day"" reheat.   
* A manual reheat button as well.  
* Doesn't make too much of a mess
* As someone building a coffee addiction of my own, what other features am I looking for?

By default, I've had pretty good luck with Oxo so I think I'd grab [https://www.oxo.com/barista-brain-9-cup-coffee-maker.html](https://www.oxo.com/barista-brain-9-cup-coffee-maker.html), but that's once again expensive enough that I'd rather ask for advice than buy something.","Simplest drip coffee maker with auto-shutoff?

Most cost effective way to make cold brew,"Hi,

I bought a Tayeka cold brew pitcher, and its great! I just wonder if there is any way to use less grounds per batch because it really burns through my beans. I did a 1:4 ratio because that's what it recommends, but would it be possible to do a smaller ratio like 1:6 or 1:8 and brew it longer? Or should I stick will 1:4 and dilute the concentrate slightly. I like my coffee pretty strong and I usually drink it black. 

Any tips for saving beans helps!

Thanks!","Most cost effective way to make cold brew Hi,

Migration from Wilfa Uniform to Niche Zero; not sure about it.,"Hi all
 
I drink between two/three V60s a day on a 16/250 ratio and had been using the Wilfa exclusively for V60 or AeroPress methods for about two years.  I pre-ordered the Niche in March and it was delivered last week.  I am aware that popular opinion is that the Wilfa is better for V60 and the Niche for espressos but I have to admit I didn’t expect such a marked difference in V60 quality.
 
My main objection with the Wilfa was the noise and that it scatters grinds everywhere when you pull the basket out.  In these respects the Niche has it beaten but that’s about it as far as I can tell.
 
I’m grinding light roast beans at setting 45 on the Niche and although the grinds look about right and certainly appear ‘fluffier’ I am surprised by the amount of fines the Niche is producing.  I would hardly get any with the Wilfa but now the paper on the V60 is black with fine sludge.  I am not convinced the coffee is any more delicious with the Niche.
 
Maybe I am doing it wrong?
 
I’m going to buy a Flair 58 and get into espresso and perhaps at that point I’ll ‘get’ the Niche.  If it carries on like this the Wilfa will be coming back out.","Migration from Wilfa Uniform to Niche Zero; not sure about it. Hi all

"Espresso beginner, still no good shots","Hello there,

I'm new to espresso and still practicing. Using my Gaggia Classic Pro (with 9bar opv mod) and a Sette 30, but I still haven't got one single good espresso shot. I tried dark roast, different grind sizes from 10 on the Sette, to 8 with different dosings (15,5g - 17g) in the double basket which came with the GCP. All within 20-30s tasted way too bitter, so I tried a medium roast. Same story, all way too bitter. Now I tried a lighter roast, again different grind settings from 9 to 5 and dosings from 15,5g - 17,5g, but these were all waaaay too sour/acidic. Tried shots from 22ish seconds - 38s. Haven't tasted anything 'sweet' in all the shots I pulled.

I think I will earn a reward for watching all the youtube tutorials on how to dial in, but still no reward for good espresso... 

Maybe I overlook something, or just don't have the skills to pull a good espresso shot. 

Hopefully somebody can give me good tips on how to set the base right.","Espresso beginner, still no good shots Hello there,

Confusion about Espresso Shot Sizing,"Morning all.

Many, many sources on the web indicate that the weight of an espresso shot is 1oz, a double espresso naturally therefore being 2oz. This equates for us metric folks as approximately 30ml/30g per shot, 60g for a double espresso. The grounds on the input side being around 9g for a single shot, 18g for a double.

My confusion is that many, many other sources, particularly on YT, indicate that the 'God Shot' of espresso, is 18g in and based upon a 1:2 ratio, 36-40g out, in 25-30 seconds. Now even my basic maths, can see that 36g is significantly different, as a measure of double espresso to the 2oz/60g standard measure, quoted by innumerable sources.

Both can't be right, so is one over-extracting or is the other under-extracting?","Confusion about Espresso Shot Sizing Morning all.

struggling with brewing espresso,"Hi. Newbie to espresso here (normally aeropress or stove top coffee maker). Was given a relatively old Gaggia baby classic for free and can't seem to get a good brew! It tends to run through too fast and not have any Crema! 

I have used a couple of different grind sizes from a local roaster (3,4,5) and asked for espresso style coffee. It's been used within 30 mins of being ground. (I am saving for a gridner, but don't have my own yet). No matter how hard I tamp down I get a shot that only takes about 10 seconds to pull.

Is this a pressure issue ? A portaflilter issue ? Something else ? Grind size doesn't seem to change the shot quality? Tamping as hard as I possibly can does slightly. I have tried both a double and single portaflilter. Am I missing something? Apologies first time ever using an espresso machine","struggling with brewing espresso Hi.

Espresso machines accessible to the blind,"Hello,

I’m completely blind and was wondering if there were any low vision or fellow blind coffee lovers on this forum that could help out with some input. Even sighted folks for that matter…

I’ve been considering getting an espresso machine. Currently, I’m using this AeroPress recipe https://www.javapresse.com/blogs/aeropress/aeropress-espresso-recipe which can do a semi-decent job, but I’d like to upgrade to something that can actually pull real espresso shots. Is anyone who’s completely blind successfully using a quality espresso machine? For the sighted folks, are you using a machine where you don’t have to pay attention to what you’re doing to operate it or could get away with not having to look at what you’re doing for example? 

I know as a blind person I right off the bat have to stay away from machines with touch screens and capacitive buttons. My preference is to also stay away from anything that relies on any sort of app or Wifi connectivity.

I’ve used a moka pot in the past and wasn’t a real fan. I also don’t need something with all sorts of bells or whistles like an integrated grinder, frother and scale as I already have a Baratza Virtuoso and accessible kitchen scale. Really just something that’s capable of pulling two shots and has a removable water tank to measure out the water I suppose.

I was gifted a Ninja coffee maker for Christmas that had all sorts of functions, but it unfortunately had one of those capacitive buttons with a menu you had to cycle through to pick what you wanted to do. There was no way I could use it.

I know you can go down the rabbit hole when it comes to espresso, but I’d like to keep my budget around $600 max.

If anyone’s got any suggestions or hands-on input on any models that can be operated mainly with tactile buttons and or switches/levers, I’d appreciate it. 

Thanks,","Espresso machines accessible to the blind Hello,

Looking to buy an iced coffee set up from scratch,"My girlfriend is graduating college soon, and recently she’s been drinking more iced coffee. Typically she’s a fan of Starbucks lattes with like vanilla flavoring, that sort of thing. Obviously this can get expensive and I thought it would be a nice idea to get her an iced coffee station as a gift! I know this requires a few things like a coffee maker, grounds, flavorings, etc. I just don’t know where to start, considering there are even multiple methods one can use to make iced coffee.

I’ll say this, generally I think an easier set-up for her would be best. I don’t think any extra effort when preparing the coffee would be worth the extra quality for her, if there are multiple ways to go about it.

Back on the French Press,"A few weeks ago I happened to open my Amazon app and a decent looking French press was advertised as on sale on the homepage. *buy it now* 

When I was younger I had a press (and an aero press at one point, too) that probably got lost in a move. 

A couple years ago my wife got into the elector tea kettle game and it was a game changer. 

I’ve been getting re-acquainted with the process for a couple weeks now and I have to agree that it’s the best cup of coffee I’ve ever made at home. 

I didn’t have a coffee grinder, electric kettle or a food scale when I had my first press. These are essential to making the French press process as simple as possible.

IMS basket with sage barista express.. problems!,"So I bought a 54mm basket for the sage barrista express and it fits the portafilter perfectly (I also bought a bottomless portafilter but that's an aside). 

I have had to go to the finest setting in the built in grinder and even stripped and cleaned out the conical burr and set the internal on #1 the finest grind setting but still it runs way faster than i think it should. 

Having run 18/19/20/22gram shots (yes I've wasted a few grams of beans) I can't get the shot to run past 21, 22 seconds for 2:1 ratio.

I use a WDT for a gentle groom, palm tamp that consistently compresses the puck and it still runs fast. 

When I go back to the sage basket which has a more angled wall getting narrower to the bottom I can get a slower run time of about 26 seconds.

Making a batch of iced coffee to keep in the fridge for the day? Does the flavor keep?,"Has anyone here made a big batch of iced coffee and kept it in the fridge to sip on during the day? I've been considering doing this for more gradual caffeine consumption rather than taking it all in at once, and also so I only have to brew my coffee once rather than multiple times during the day. I've done cold brew before and that's worked well for this purpose, but I prefer the taste of iced coffee, and it's much faster to make, so I'm curious if anyone's tried this and how well it's worked, and how long it took for the flavor to deteriorate. I'm likely going to try it myself, but it'd be nice to know beforehand so I don't waste a bunch of coffee.","Making a batch of iced coffee to keep in the fridge for the day? Does the flavor keep?

My Aeropress gave me second degree burns today - what to replace it with?,"So as many other have had happen, my aeropress essentially exploded boiling hot coffee grounds and gave me some nasty burns all down one forearm and my stomach. The seal seems to have degraded over time.

So I’m ideally looking to replace it. I really like the coffee the aeropress produces - I prefer it over a French press or other brewing methods. 

Someone mentioned looking at “super-automatic espresso machines”. The rub is I really only like black coffee with a bit of cream. No mochas or cappuccino or espressos. Would one of these automatic machines still brew a good cup of black coffee or is it overkill?

1zpresso K-Max is jammed.,"Hi.

I can't disassemble, because I can't loosen it, and if coffee is stuck between the burrs, I can't grind it because I'm almost certain I will wreck my burrs if I do so.

Has this happened to anyone here?
Is my only hope returning this and getting a new one?

How to recreate a store-bought McDonald's hazelnut iced coffee with cold brew?,"OK, I'm sure I will get judgment for this, but I really love the McDonald's hazelnut iced coffee, and I'd just like to recreate it at home - in particular I'd love a dairy-free alternative, as I am very lactose intolerant.

Coffee Newbie and Moka Pot Coffee,"Hi All

Having been exclusively a tea drinker for all my adult life, I've recently decided to put my toe in the water of coffee...what a revelation, flavour! 

Typically I began the day with a 12oz (350ml) Starbucks Americano and due to covid, decided to go the Moka Pot route and now have a 6-cup pot, which yields about 240-260ml, the basket taking around 25g of ground coffee. Moka Pot coffee is of course somewhat stronger than an Americano and I've been adding around 80ml of hot milk, to bring me up to my usual 120z cup of joe!

However, reading on other sites, it appears that the 6-cup moka is really aimed at two people, with the 3 cup Moka Pot recommended for one person.

What am I missing? Am I doing something really unusual, unhealthy by having a complete 6-cup Moka Pot's worth of coffee? In my defence, it really only does provide what would be considered a standard size cup of coffee, but given the numerous references to this being too much, I'm wondering if there i something fundamental I'm missing?","Coffee Newbie and Moka Pot Coffee Hi All

"[Help] How to Grind Coffee Green Beans, on an industrial scale?","TL;DR: Poor friend has a million dollar coffe product, but not the right machine to produce it in scale. Where to find the right machine?

Hey guys!!

I'm very new into the ""coffee culture"" (but getting addicted fast!) - so my apologies if i say something ignorant.

I've made a friend in Indonesia that was selling coffee green bean powder, not roasted, and having very good success as the product is of very high quality and nobody seems to produce it the same way.

But the machines she uses to grind the beans aren't up to the task as they keep breaking.

She's getting discouraged which is a shame because with the success the product has, she can set herself and her family up for life if only she can continue producing.

So...

I come to you all, coffee experts, to ask:

does any of you know of a supplier, custom maker, or available machine capable of pulverising this rock like beans?

Your help can make a big difference in the lifes of a bunch of people.

Thank you very much!!","[Help] How to Grind Coffee Green Beans, on an industrial scale? TL;DR: Poor friend has a million dollar coffe product, but not the right machine to produce it in scale. Where to find the right machine?

(Repair?) Nuova Simonelli Appia Pump ‘clicking’ (engaging on/off) for 10mins from turn on?,"Hi 👋 
My friend has an Appia at their coffee shop that had a steam leak from the vacuum pressure valve (no biggie, disassembled it, cleaned it and reinstalled it)

However, when I asked them to turn the machine on again - to check for any pressure leaks during warm up, the pump would engage and disengage with that audible ‘click’ multiple times..(in my thought process from owning a Victoria Arduino Adonis) this would happen once to allow the boiler to refill to the required level before heating the water, however with my friend’s machine, it seemed to just constantly click [engage] on(or off?) repeatedly for 10-20 mins. With a frequency of 3-5seconds between each pulse (engagement).

I presume that there may be either a problem with the pump itself, an associated solenoid (or the [Auto-level Sensor - Part # 09000003]) however, rather than just changing parts here and there (a layman repair technique), I was wondering if anyone has had a similar problem, and could provide either insight (about the problem, symptoms and solution) or to clarify a way to accurately diagnose if this is the case?

For example - is there a voltage / resistance that can be measured with a multimeter to check that the sensor is indeed working, and if the voltage / resistance is fluctuating correctly with the operation of the machine?

The rapid engaging / disengaging (off and on -&gt; ‘clicking’) isn’t actually adding water to the boiler at all, and I suspect that it is impeding the warm-up time of the machine, and potentially wearing out the pump with it’s intermittent operation.

I haven’t timed the machine’s warm up, that can be done - if required, but any information that could be of assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","(Repair?) Nuova Simonelli Appia Pump ‘clicking’ (engaging on/off) for 10mins from turn on? Hi 👋

gaggia coffee deluxe- what should i look out for?,"Hi all!

I'm currently looking at a used Gaggia Coffee Deluxe being sold near me for $75. Currently my ""espresso"" fix is being filled with just OK aeropress concentrated shots and too much money to my local coffee shop, so I'm thinking about biting the bullet and picking this one up. The seller says it works fine, but I'm totally new to espresso machines - I'm a flash pourover and cold brew kinda gal- and I have no idea what I should be looking for once I get it/if I get it. 

A few questions-

Between this and a used Flair NEO for the same price, which is more capable, steam wand aside?
I've heard it's similar to the Gaggia Classic but without the 3 way valve. I won't need that if I'm just looking at doing plain ol' double shots, right?
Same with the frothing wand, I'm an iced shaken espresso and iced latte drinker because... Texas, so if the wand has issues will it impact the whole thing, or is it fine?
What sort of issues should I be on the lookout for in terms of fixing/replacing? Are replacement parts still readily available or will it be a new old stock situation?
My current grinder is a trusty Porlex Mini that fits in my aeropress (it goes with me home, to hotels, to friends houses, the like)... will that on the finest settings be sufficient for the time being? Or would I be better off looking for a dedicated espresso grinder secondhand? I'm a college student so my budget is sort of limited for anything nicer.

1. Does anyone have any glue or connection recommendation for metal on metal? Let's assume I do not have ability to re-weld this myself so am limited to adhesives that need to withstand 100c temps.

Stumptown Holler Mountain acidic?,"I can't drink Starbucks coffee I find it way too acidic, the acidity is over powering to me. Once I discovered Holler Mountain it became one of my favorite coffees.  What I appreciate most is that it seems very neutral, I can't taste the acid at all like I can with Starbucks. As I was searching for coffees that are similar, and maybe lower priced, I came across a review of Holler Mountain. A good deal of the review is how acidic the coffee is! I can't wrap my head around this. I would think I just like acidic coffee except for my prior Starbucks experience. I can't understand what someone thinks of Starbucks if Holler Mountain is far too acidic, and if that was common I can't imagine how Starbucks are even in business. So I'm trying to discover if the reviewer or I are the outlier? Do you find Holler Mountain acidic?

Used bean-to-cup machine: Evaluating options,"I have a very basic manual espresso machine at the moment, and looking to upgrade to an auto or semi-auto bean to cup machine.

I'm considering a few options on used machines at the moment, all at a similar price. I'm based in South Africa so available options are somewhat limited. (I'll do USD price equivalents for ease of evaluation)

Gaggia Platinum Swing - $175

Gaggia Naviglio Deluxe - $155

Saeco Talea Ring - $125

Delonghi ecam 23.210 - $185

How much does brew size affect grind settings?,"I've only just figured out that when dialing in the grind, brew size matters.  If you go from a small serving at a given ratio, and then brew a larger batch at the same ratio in the same type of brewer, the grind has to be courser to stay ""dialed in."" But … by how much? Does anybody know?

For example, I have noticed that when I dial in the perfect grind for a v60, it's no longer the correct grind if I brew at a different volume. Sometimes I do a little mug of 220g into 13g while other times, I might fill a big carter move with 450g into 29g. The perfect grind for each is wildly different.","How much does brew size affect grind settings? I've only just figured out that when dialing in the grind, brew size matters.

Making my Own Coffee Concentrate,"Hey folks,

im trying to make my own coffee concentrate - similar to what is being sold by the company Jot (only one ive found so far)

I know a process called “reverse gravitational extraction” is used by Jot to produce this concentrate, but i am unsure as to what this really is. 

I thought that it might have just been a really strong cold brew but the Jot concentrate tastes completely different. The reverse gravitational extraction process is also supposed to yield coffee that is 20x concentrated. I dont believe that this is possible with cold brew...

Can anyone please help me in understanding this process? Is it replicable at home? I want to be able to extract MORE from my beans and I am curious about the overall process 

Any info greatly appreciated","Making my Own Coffee Concentrate Hey folks,

Is a single serve (non pod) brewer any more convenient than pourover?,"My new job is WFH and what used to be a weekend thing has now been my daily grind. Except I don't really find myself grinding beans, I just getting a decent bag of pre-ground from a local store that I like, measure x g of coffee and pour in x g of water and do my brew.

Now I'm just looking for something more convenient. Set it and come back 5 min later to a cup. I don't want to use K-Cups or even the reusable pods, they are annoying to clean. And I do prefer paper filters, so I was hoping to get something that can use readily available #4 or #2 filters - my only source for Hario filters is online which is annoying.

Breville Precision Brewer Problems," 

So I've had these machines for 7 months. For the first 6 they were great, I could really dial in the flavor using different settings. Recently though, the coffee has become bitter and bland. Worse than Foldgers, Keurig or any of the inedible stuff you can buy.

I've been buying the same roasts(mainly from social coffee in Toronto- they do light to medium roasts and their beans are well reviewed). The roast im using currently I used to grind at a fairly fine 35 on my SGP and it was fairly fruit forward but above everything quite smooth and sweet. Now regardless of grind setting(I've tried everything between a fine 30 and massively course 60) its trash just slightly less bitter at the upper end. I've played with every setting on mybrew(currently at 196f for temp, 30 second bloom and slow flow) and the gold setting but it changes nothing. I've descaled my machine two weeks ago, I always rinse out each component and I clean my grinder weekly.

My current brew ratio is 50 grams of coffee roughly to 30 oz of water

Has anyone had similar problems with either machine? am I doing something wrong or are Breville products just unreliable( used to have a breville oracle- the heating fuse took a dump within a year)","Breville Precision Brewer Problems

Possibly Becoming a Cold Brew Convert (pro tip included!),"[I wrote this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/one9h7/getting_hard_to_find_a_true_iced_coffee/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) a while back lambasting the merits of cold brew and lamenting that it's getting harder to find more of a classic style ""iced coffee"" as coffee shops seem to be prioritizing the former over the latter. There was a fiery debate about the definition of iced coffee so I'll TLDR that for you here as to my definition: Coffee that is traditional hot brewed, then cooled (preferably quickly) and then once cooled, poured over ice and drank.

After many months of experimenting with both at home I have come to a realization about cold brew: It comes out SO MUCH better (IMO) when you use a light roast. I've been doing a 96 hour steep in the fridge, and have been coming to realize that when you use a darker roast it starts to taste further from what I associate with a ""coffee"" flavor, whereas when you use a medium or light roast there are a lot more flavors that come through. I'm not a fan of those Trader Joe's cold brew concentrates - and I find that that's what the darker roast CBs come to taste like.

Not a forever convert, I like to switch off between both CB and IC (TBH I'm a sucker for a standard black Starbucks Iced Coffee - they really have it down), but certainly less of a CB hater now.

"Made bad cold brew, HELP!!!","What's up guys hope you are having a wonderful day.

So what can I add to make it taste good like milk, syrups, or coffee cream.
Please give me your best recipe.

Also can I use heavy cream instead of coffee cream?

Moka pot first grinder,"So I'm very new to the coffe game. I've been making my coffe in Moka pot for years using pre-grounded coffe, but I've always heard that the most important thing about coffe is to grind fresh.  


I do not plan to buy an espresso machine, my ways of making coffe are moka pot and maybe aeropress (when I get one).

 1) Hario skerton pro 2) Timemore C2 3)1zpresso Q2

"Steel french press, burr grinder - how to make nice and not bitter coffee?","Hello,

So I have a big steel french press, it comfortably makes two full mugs and its full capacity was listed (by the seller on Amazon) as 1.2 L. I really like steel because glass cracks easily in the dishwasher.

I also have a Krups burr grinder. So I expected some nice coffee - but am failing to make it. Instead, it's either watery or bitter.

The Internet (tm) says use coarser grinds, somewhat large amounts of coffee, limit brewing to 5 minutes. But it gets bitter. Smaller amounts with a coarse grind get watery; with a finer grind, bitter again.

I did also start preheating the steel french press first by keeping some freshly-boiled water in it, covered, for a minute while rocking the press. Things got somewhat better but not a lot.

So what's the secret here? How can I work out the formula for coffee that would be full-bodied but not bitter?

I did google now and there is that James Hoffman video with the idea of stirring after a  few minutes and then just throwing away what remains on top. Not sure this makes sense to me as the stirring already distributes all the bitter stuff? Maybe I should stir at the start of the brewing, then just take the top off after the (4 minute?) brewing before the plunging? Or what else do I do, anyway?","Steel french press, burr grinder - how to make nice and not bitter coffee? Hello,

I want to get a better understanding of where people see the value in getting a coffee subscription service, and if there are any pain points when using them. 

Fellow just released their drops text-to-order subscription service which seems to be an interesting take on the whole subscription idea. But beyond them, most of the services feel the same. 

While I usually just go out and buy locally roasted coffee, I can see where subscription services could be useful. Specifically in places where there aren't any good roasters or limited variety. 

For people who use subscription services, what's the main driver for doing so? Is it mainly a convenience factor? Wanting to try new roasters from across the country? Or simply the easiest way to get well roasted coffee in your neck of the woods. 

Hopefully this post doesn't get taken down, I'd love to start a conversation around this topic. Excited to see your answers!","Understanding the Value of coffee subscription models Ok so since my last post got removed by the mods for being low-effort, I'm going to try this with a bit more effort...

Breville Barista Express: Gauge says shots are very underextracted. Tips?,"Title says it all. I'm using the stock parts and it's the only coffee gear I have and I don't want to buy more right now. I'm using the single-walled double-shot basket with fresh whole beans. The settings are the ones they recommend (grinder on 5, amount at 3 o'clock).

I'm auto dosing using their recommended amount, but it feels like way too much. I accidentally manually dosed on my first use and it was perfect.

I think that's the issue. But I don't know how to be sure.

"interest in latte art classes, either in person or online?","A guest came to my shop the other day asking about coffee/latte art classes in my city (I live in the states.) I told her about Counter Culture, but it was the only thing that came to mind.  She told me that it's common in Korea to have coffee training centers open to the public. 

It seems to me that interest in specialty coffee is growing in the usa, but I'm wondering how successful any of you have been in finding trainings or seminars here.

Weird and noob coffee grinder question,"Hi!

Bit of a noob question here, but **what does this ""ring"" thing does?**

So I just got this Barista Space Hand Grinder. It has some kind of rubber placed here normally ([look](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1921/8479/products/32833_large.jpg?v=1626257271)), so it is not visible immediately.

I never had a proper grinder, so I did not know it was there. I started grinding. And I noticed it moves left and right. Because I grabbed it relatively firmly and put some power into grinding, it changed my grind size, until it was so small it was not grinding.

I get it, hold it in a way that doesn't change the size.But... **Why is it there? Why does it move left and right, allowing me to change the size when I don't want to change it?**

Actually, the way I hold things allows me to change it even when I'm opening the coffee tank. It's just weird.

Right now I am a bit annoyed because it seems very unintuitive.So maybe you can help me with that. I don't know, I am confused AF. If that's the most stupid coffee question here, so be it :D

Made a dumb mistake now concerned about my machine...,"TLDR; made an idiotic error by forgetting to put the pot under the drip machine, and the whole pot dripped directly onto the hot plate :) is it safe to use?

Hi all, I hope this is ok to post here, I can't seem to find anywhere else!

In my tired fog this morning, I made a pot of coffee using my Smeg drip coffee machine ([https://www.smeg.com/drip-filter-coffee-machine](https://www.smeg.com/drip-filter-coffee-machine)) WITHOUT putting the damn pot into the dock. So I came back into the kitchen and obviously the coffee was all over the machine and counter. I cleaned it all up and turned it off at the mains, took the basket out etc.

My question now is, is it safe to use? I'm worried that the coffee has gotten under the hot plate (it almost certainly has as when I leave it for a few hours there's a small puddle of coffee under the machine) and that will make it like, I dunno, go on fire or explode or something. I might sound a bit silly here, I'm just not totally sure how it works...

We don't really wanna start taking it apart if we can help it, but should we?

TIA, any kind of insight is much appreciated!!","Made a dumb mistake now concerned about my machine... TLDR; made an idiotic error by forgetting to put the pot under the drip machine, and the whole pot dripped directly onto the hot plate :) is it safe to use?

I like instant coffee,"I know that is is sacrilege for most coffee enjoyers, but as a lifelong black coffee drinker, I recently came to terms with the fact that I enjoy the taste of instant coffee more than most other methods. When I was younger, I convinced myself that coffee had to taste STRONG or I somehow wasn't a valid coffee drinker. 

I'm extremely sensitive to bitter tastes (supertaster), but I like aspects of black coffee, and I realized that I don't think I ever actually enjoyed any of the strong coffee I drank. 

I guiltily enjoyed 'weak' diner coffee, fast food coffee or the cheap coffee you'd get in those little teabag filters in hotel rooms. I tried my hand at pour-over, thinking that it would help me control the strength more, but that was too much work for multiple cups of coffee. On a whim, I bought a container of basic nabob instant coffee and it is THE BEST. I just throw a scoop into some hot water whenever I need a cup without all the fuss of setting it up to brew on something, and no excess waste like a coffee pod machine.","I like instant coffee I know that is is sacrilege for most coffee enjoyers, but as a lifelong black coffee drinker, I recently came to terms with the fact that I enjoy the taste of instant coffee more than most other methods.

pour-over receipes : single vs multiple pours,"wanted to gather some thoughts on this  
coarser grind and multiple pours VS fine grind and single pour (after bloom)

this always intrigued me as to the fundamental differences between the two

james hoffman/ scott rao seems to prefer the single pour, while we have all seen brewers cup champion recipes mainly doing multiple pours

my understanding is that coarser grinds act as a ""safety net"" to avoid over-extraction in several ways

* lower temperature, heat loss is greater when you allow the water to drain before pouring again
* coarser grinds less prone to overextraction
* a bed with coarser grinds channel less

downside is that you are putting a ceiling on the flavours available for extraction as you are leaving some coffee unavailable for extraction at the centre of the coarser grinds.

Budget burr grinder that's small for french press only.,"I did search but most of the results were a few years old..

So I've been using a french press for a couple years now with a blade grinder (I just found out how much blade grinders are frowned upon).

Is that actually true? will I notice a big difference or do you have to have a sophisticated pallet to notice?

Anyways, I figure I'll give a burr grinder a try to see. I only use a French Press and only make one large cup at a time so I'd like a small grinder. I'm also cheap so I'm looking for best bang for the buck kinda deal. Will also be looking on marketplace for used. Budget is around $75-$100.

ECM Casa V owners - need your advice!,"hello everyone,

hope you are well.

&amp;#x200B;

i am in need for help regarding casa v maintenance and care. my gf doesn't do anything to take care of machine and decided to get some knowledge regarding this.

&amp;#x200B;

i got couple of questions:

&amp;#x200B;

\- what are good products for cleaning entire machine? (not just grouphead with back flushing) - but inside parts/pipes etc

&amp;#x200B;

\- shall i replace silicon rings in group head? (attaching image below - there is thick red one and thin one inside group head that are quite hard at the moment and not the flexible anymore. is it worth changing?)

&amp;#x200B;

\- from the image attached below - how could i clean the limescale? back flushing doesn't help and i do not want to scratch/damage it. hard brush that came together with machine does not work either. soaking with solution is impossible - hard place to soak in

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

tried checking lots of videos but couldn't find specific in depth guide for these answers. ecm community is not that big!

"Need some help!. 1zpresso, comandante, timemore, etc... Which one is better for making espresso?","Hello Guys,

I  want to dive into the espresso world. I have been looking for hand  grinders and portable machines for a while. I travel a lot and so  portable tools are my focus. To begin with, I have started by ordering  the Picopresso. I think one of the best portable coffee machines is the  Picopresso. When it comes to the hand grinders, I got stuck with  indecision.

Which product is best suited for making espresso? Some of them -&gt;J-Max, Jx Pro, K-Max, Comandante C40, Molent,Timemore X etc.

How  many microns will I need for each click to extract all flavours from  coffee beans and get a well-balanced taste with good complexity and  body? 8.8(J-Max), 12,5 (Jx Pro), 15(comandante with red clix, or 30  without it), 22 ( K-Series) etc. Which product will best combined with  the Picopresso? which one offers long-last using? These are some of my  questions. While struggling with the question, I watched a comparison  (the link is below) of Comandante and Jx-Max in terms of making espresso  today.

I will probably prefer the  Comandante option even if it requires more effort than others. After  this long consideration, I just wanted to share this comparison video  that helped me decide what to do. I will be grateful if you let me know  your comments about my decision.

I need help with making Iced Coffee.,"Today I had made iced coffee for my mother and I. I’ve tried several times yet still cannot make a perfect cup.

I have a dumb question lol,"If one single K cup has 75-150mg of caffeine, does that mean that no matter how many oz of water I choose on my keurig, I’m getting the same amount of caffeine? 

I’m asking because I need to cut back on caffeine but I’m so used to drinking 3 cups a day. I was thinking if I brew one k cup with 16 oz of water instead of 8 that maybe I could trick myself into thinking I’m having 2 cups right there but it’s really just one cup worth of caffeine. I would use half-caff or decaf but I’ve finally found my favorite k cup and I don’t like straying from it lol. 

Also don’t hate on me for using a keurig lol. I don’t have time to use my French press in the mornings and my drip coffee maker is in storage. 😬","I have a dumb question lol If one single K cup has 75-150mg of caffeine, does that mean that no matter how many oz of water I choose on my keurig, I’m getting the same amount of caffeine?

What is this machine? It looks like a mix between an espresso machine and a filter coffee machine.,"So, Im not very wealthy, so most of the machines/appliances and gadgets I buy come from charity shops. And one day I saw a coffee machine in a charity shop, for £5, that could apparently make espresso, and so obviously I bought it.

But, after looking online at other coffee machines, and especially espresso machines, I noticed that this doesnt look remotley like any of them.

I also can't find any mention of the product online.

The coffee it makes comes out in small quantities, and quite strong, alot like espresso. But the way it functions is confusing to me.

This is what the machine looks like:

It's also got a steamer on the side.

Does anyone know what this machine is, and what it's designed to make?","What is this machine? It looks like a mix between an espresso machine and a filter coffee machine.

Are my V60 brews supposed to not taste as good as they do?,"I don't understand; for a few months now, I've been on this subreddit mostly as a Clever Dripper user, though I also used an Aeropress for a bit and recently have also been using OXO's melitta cone with a shower tank, all of which I've had good results with. I've also had a Hario Switch that I've gotten decent results out of, though I've never really liked its lack of heat retention. Recently, I've just decided to try my plastic V60 cone that I got off of Amazon with the supposedly shitty tabbed V60 filters that came with my Switch, and... all my brews have been good? Well, I suppose the first one was merely just alright, which was my attempt at the Hoffman method that I sort of bungled, but afterwards I've used [this method I found on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdGZh48rP5E), and then the [Onyx method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V30qg_pQ9mY), and I've been consistently getting good quality cups. The taste does vary, of course, which I expected, but they've all been *good*, which is what I considered important. I've just been using a shitty OXO electric burr grinder (set to setting 6 for the first method, and 4 for the Onyx one) and boiling water from a Bonavita gooseneck kettle (set to 98C), as well, and that's been getting me good results. I've been drinking all the coffee black, too. I've just been using Happy Mug Bigfoot Espresso Blend and Illy Decaf, and neither is as fresh as they could be. Maybe my taste buds are just broken? But for me, I haven't made a cup any worse than the Clever Dripper did, and some of them have been even better. There's been no bitterness and they've all had good flavor, though I will admit I'm not too great at tasting notes or anything like that. But even just looking at the front page, at topics that are currently there right now, a lot of other people are having woes with the V60 that I just... don't seem to be having, and I'm not sure why, especially as a beginner. Granted, I've not really had other V60 cups to compare it to, as there's not many non-Starbucks cafes within a few miles, and I absolutely hate the burnt taste of their coffee, so all the coffee I drink has been made at home.","Are my V60 brews supposed to not taste as good as they do?

Is a pour over for me?,"I love coffee but not the light roast bright fruity hipster stuff that seems very popular everywhere in Brooklyn.

Please help me find my perfect coffee machine.,"Tl:Dr at bottom 

Okay, so I am not a coffee super fan, at least not yet. Several months ago when looking for replacements for my old Keurig, an machine I got when I was younger and never used, I got another Keurig called the K-cafe, which was advertised to make lattes and cuppaccinos and froth milk. So, I got that, and then went down this weird rabbit hole of looking for other machines when I realized the “espresso” was really just concentrated coffee, and if I’m being completely honest I was just excited to try making cool designs but realized that Crema is a necessary component to latte art, and the k-cafe fake-espresso has none of that. It’s also a cost issue, since the pods cost a lot. I fixed the cost issue with a refillable pod, but it’s extremely specific on the grind type (for instance, I can’t buy cafe bustelo ground in bulk) but then I just thought, there has to be something that can accepts ground coffee, is instant and convenient like Keurig, and makes both coffee and espresso shots. When I type “coffee+espresso” maker, they all have a traditional drip-coffee machine, and I literally don’t have the time in the day to wait on those to fill up. 

Tl;dr: looking for a instant ground-to-cup coffee maker that can make real espresso and coffee, allowing me to use regular and fine grounds instead of pods but with same quick convenience. Milk frothed is a plus.","Please help me find my perfect coffee machine. Tl:Dr at bottom

Best way to track taste preferences across home and cafes?,"I've liked coffee for most of my life at this point, but I've started to try and learn more. Through high school and college it was all Starbucks all the time. After a decade and trying a lot of cafes in the area I'm trying to find what I like and how best to brew at home. 

I currently have an aeropress for travel (that I recently learned I was not letting it steep properly), a Moka pot, and several cheaper espresso machines at home, with a super automatic Espressione Concierge at my office (because it's easy). 

I usually do 2:1 milk (not steamed or frothed) to coffee ratio. Sometimes I'll add a sweetener but not always. 

I also have been traveling to various cafes and trying different things. If they roast themselves, I'll just get a simple cappuccino, but if not I'll try a flavored latte (which obviously masks the coffee but if they're not roasting I should try what makes that cafe special right?)

What does the community recommend? I buy beans from each roaster and I guess I'm looking for a way to track what I like best and how to translate that to a home machine.","Best way to track taste preferences across home and cafes?

My V60 makes all my beans taste the same,"I've been using my Aeropress for years, and I'm able to get great, flavourful, bright coffees from my beans. But a few months ago I bought a V60 to try something new and bring out unique notes, however I've found that every single brew regardless of the variables I change tastes the same.

It's not a bad brew per se, but everything comes out smooth, medium body, non-acidic, non-bitter, with no clear notes. If I were to serve coffee to friends who weren't into specialty coffee, I would probably choose this since it's so un-offensive. I like to have very bright punchy notes, and just generally be able to taste the individuality of each bean.

For reference, I'm using the technique recommended by James Hoffmann on his YouTube channel. I've tried it now with different bean:water ratio, grind sizes, and temperatures.

Debugging moka pot bad coffee due to all the grounds migrating to one side of the basket,"Hello r/coffee. I use a moka pot; usually it works very well. But just now I made some and it was horrible -- very weak, bitter, and sour.

I don't know why it would do this though. I didn't think I was doing anything different from what I'd normally do. The grounds were evenly distributed when dry (not tamped, as that's advised against for moka pots). The stove wasn't noticeably non-level.

Need help identifying commercial single-cup coffee machine from picture taken in 2003.,"This may be a longshot, but I need help identifying this beast. it's a single-cup commercial-grade coffee machine that was in the kitchen nook at the printing company my family used to own, up until it closed in 2004. This is the only image I have of the absolute unit. I can remember it was hooked to a double-filtered tap supply and despite having a bunch of different menu settings, was only ever used for regular and decaf coffee. I asked my father and grandmother and both can't remember what brand it was, but that it was acquired in the mid-90s through a restaurant supplier, of whom also delivered to them regular 6-month shipments of Lacas coffee, ketchup/mustard packets, sugar packets, and the usual assortment of pink/yellow/blue sweetener packets to boot.

In its lifetime it only ever broke down once, and it was something to do with a manufacturer defect in a seal that led to quite a bit of water on the floor-- covered under service warranty, of course. aside from this, it was a workhorse, and the employees who frequented it had the machine dialed in for a perfect 8oz cup every time (or so says my grandmother). I can partly blame this machine for my love of coffee today, as I was an early enjoyer (for the time) at 8 years old. As a kid with the ADHD type that calmed down with caffeine, coffee was my savior, no matter what it tasted like.

Despite the image depicting such, the machine was not coin-op enabled, and the coin/change mechanism was disabled if it had it installed to begin with, something that slips my own memory. I can remember it taking a time to warm up, and I think it used straight-up pre-ground coffee as I do remember the inside having a waste grounds container. However, I can't make out the brand label on the front-top-left to save my life, and my google-fu must be weak in this field as I'm not able to find any images of commercial-grade machines from this era to get even an inkling of what brands to look at. 

Honestly I'm doing this for nostalgia's sake, to get some better pictures and even a video if it exists. I'm sorry for the graininess of the image, it was taken on a 3.2MP Kodak camera of the time and not on the highest quality setting it could have been. If this looks in any way shape or form familiar to anyone, or if anyone has any clues toward which brand to look at, it would help a lot towards the removal of a headscratcher I've had for a couple of years now.

If this isn't the right subreddit to post this in, a recommendation of where to crosspost it would also be beneficial. I don't know if r/cafe would be more proper but it is 4AM and I'm losing sleep over this.

Why does coffee make me sleepy?,"This is a coffee related question but idk if it’s appropriate for this sub. Tell me if it’s not, thank you!

I like coffee but I don’t drink it often because it immediately makes me tired?

Typically coffee keeps you awake, focused and energized (the caffeine rush if you will) and then comes the crash, where the brain produces enough adenosine to fight the effects of caffeine. So you feel tired and sleepy or just feel less energized than before you drank coffee.

My situation is that but erase the first part. I drink coffee and I feel less energized and mildly tired and I don’t feel quite myself and my resting BPM goes down to the 70s from my usual 80-90 resting BMP (I know it’s high but that’s not the point).

Traditional vs American Menu,"Context: I own a coffee truck in Austin Texas and we’ve been in operation for about two years. I started off by only selling eight and 12 ounce beverages but my clientele (mostly college students) wanted those big abdominal size drinks so I adjusted to 12/16/20 ounce menu. As I’m getting deeper and deeper into coffee I’m realizing that I’ve been trying to compete with Starbucks instead of trying to form my own third wave specialty coffee culture. Currently have plans to open up a brick and mortar store and I’m having questions and doubts about my menu. 

Discussion: I would like to serve traditional style drinks only but I’m afraid that the people in the community are going to want those gigantic 20 ounce lattes that they always get at Starbucks.

Ruined/spoiled by grocery store Starbucks beans. Which mail-order roasters have really dark roast beans that make a really bold brew?,"I started hand pouring coffee over 40 years ago with a Melitta no. 2 and a tea kettle. Over the decades, the only change I'd made was switching to an electric kettle about 20 years ago.

On a recommendation, I tried Happy Mug's Black Velvet French.

The cup they make is quite good, but it's missing that really bold bite you get from dark roasted beans.

Mexican coffee: Cafe de Olla in a Chemex,"I know Mexicans don't really celebrate Cinco de Mayo, but I figured it as good a reason as any to try making Mexican cafe de olla in my Chemex!

Cafe de olla is usually made as immersion brewing on the stovetop, and I love it as a treat once in a while.

I used 27g of coffee. After pre-wetting the filter, I added my coffee and squeezed the juice of a mandarin orange in. I also added the zest of the orange.

I then used a blade grinder (gasp!) to grind half a cinnamon stick, adding that. I followed up with half a teaspoon of brown sugar.

If I had any, I would have also ground up half of a star anise.

After adding my ingredients, I stirred everything and brewed in three stages. 459g out.

The resulting coffee was delicious! If you haven't tried making cafe de olla before, it's wonderful! If I would change anything, I would have added a bit less orange juice, maybe squeezing in half the orange.

Trust me, this does not end up like that awful espresso with orange juice drink! It's really nice.","Mexican coffee: Cafe de Olla in a Chemex I know Mexicans don't really celebrate Cinco de Mayo, but I figured it as good a reason as any to try making Mexican cafe de olla in my Chemex!

What coffee maker should I get for my (40F) girlfriend?,"She's introducing me to coffee, but I'm (40M) still very very much a noob. She drinks coffee every morning.

I don't think she grinds her own. She prefers the coffee at Caribou Coffee when we go out rather than Starbucks. I don't know what brand she uses in her own maker. She uses creamer, but I don't know which. I'm obviously no help.

Questions about kegging cold brew and nitro cold brew,"I'm interested in offering kegs of cold brew/nitro cold brew to some bars but need some guidance from other vendors about what I should be providing and what is typically the responsibility of the customer.

The customer will have a nitrogen task for dispensing the cold brew and nitro from the kegerator. But when I am filling the kegs at my shop, do I just need to just flush the keg with nitrogen and then deliver them with the understanding they will need to infuse the nitro brew for 24 hours with nitrogen, or do cold brew vendors typically take care of that before delivery? If the latter, do you typically charge more for that keg versus the standard cold brew? Are there any good workarounds so that either myself or the customer don't need to wait 24 hours before dispensing?

Lastly, I understand there are nitrogen infusers that eliminate the need for infusing, but not sure if customers are willing to pay that upfront cost.","Questions about kegging cold brew and nitro cold brew I'm interested in offering kegs of cold brew/nitro cold brew to some bars but need some guidance from other vendors about what I should be providing and what is typically the responsibility of the customer.

Maple Flavored drinks,"Good morning everyone,

I while back I got really into maple lattes after watching a coffee shop on tv who are known for them. I found the flavor combination to be delicious but when I tried remaking it myself I came across an issue, the maple flavor was to delicate you could hardly taste it and I only got the maple syrup flavor on the back end.

After some research, I found that the maple flavor comes from the darker syrups, not only the darker syrups but also syrups extracted from later in the season. I don't use artificial maple syrups and I wouldn't say I buy the top quality since it can get pricey.

This being said, I had the idea of maybe adding maple extract to maple syrup itself and then continuing to use it as a syrup for my lattes. Will this add a weird maple flavor to the latte or can this actually enhance the maple flavor of the syrup itself to make it a little more dominate in the final product? 

Thank you as always to everybody in the community and I hope to hear back","Maple Flavored drinks Good morning everyone,

Upgrading setup for exclusively latte and milk drinks,"Hi!

As title says I am looking to upgrade my current setup of a gaggia viva style + a krups lowend burr grinder to something that is less cumbersome to use, cause the krups can't grind directly into a portafilter and produces better tasting drinks.

We almost exclusively drink lattes or cappucinos, but most of the time lately it just ends up being café a lait's as I find that the style's steam arm is eh at best, and my old nespresso automatic milk fother takes ages to clean up cause it burns milk after 1 go.

I was mainly looking at sage/breville machines cause of their automatic milk frothing function, and ended up ordering a bambino plus cause one place has it for around 330$ instead of 450$, but because they are taking their sweet time shipping it out, i started to look around more (had recently had issues with a different place not doing anything with my order for 2 months so i'm always suspicious nowadays when sites take long to even start shipping).

I was planning to pair it with a Mignon Classic Manuale/Silenzio (and a non pressurized filter if it doesn't come with one ofc), but this is where I started to wonder about how much the grinder would matter if it's almost 100% milk drinks and never straight up shots, and if I would be better of with just a lower end grinder like the SGP or even their dose control (which I could get from an another place in a pack where the machine is essentaly the same discounted price).

Any help would be appreciated

Bambino plus vs Bambino,"I've read all the posts I can find about this and a lot of the time the answer seems to be the Bambino is great value so if you're on a budget it's the one to get. 

I'm looking at a Eureka specialita as the ginder and pairing it with the  plus because while I feel I might want to steam milk manually to develop that skill I also see that the auto function is going to be great for my wife and also the times when I just want a quick drink. The only downer for me is the inability to change the espresso temperature but that's the same on both of these machines.

Considering I've decided on sage/breville because of the quick heat up times (I'm really not into waiting 10 minutes for heat up) and the extra cost isn't an issue for me is there any other reason to consider the Bambino over the plus that I'm missing?","Bambino plus vs Bambino I've read all the posts I can find about this and a lot of the time the answer seems to be the Bambino is great value so if you're on a budget it's the one to get.

Electric grinder recommendations,"Hey, sorry if this is just a repeated post.

I'm looking to buy a grinder soon (I don't have any at the moment, used to have a couple manual grinders and an electric one but then I moved).

So besides the Baratza Encore, and the Wilfa Svart, can you recommend other good grinders on a similar budget? I'm also looking for used ones, but there aren't any of those models. Also, anyone knows the difference between the Wilfa Svart Aroma and Nymant?

am I doing anaerobic wrong?,"new-ish to specialty coffee not from a grocery store so I'm still finding what I like. Thought I would give an anaerobic coffee a try for something different, after working with a few more conventional single origin coffees, so I ordered some of the ""carlos plazas cinnamon anaerobic"" from black &amp; white. 

This morning I opened the bag and immediately noticed a very not-coffee smell that was honestly not at all appealing to me. I continued with my morning ritual, measuring out 25g for my usual 400ml v60 pour over, thinking that maybe it would taste different from how it smelled, more appetizing. It did not. I tasted it by itself the first few sips trying to see if I could get any of the flavors. Tasted kind of like someone steeped a soggy pineapple for a few hours in cold brew and then heated it up and took out all the sweetness. I tried to save it thinking maybe it would be better with a bit of milk and sugar but that just made it worse, a funky mix of wilted headache inducing fruitiness and milk. The aftertaste for me was even worse, something that lingered in my nose and throat for several hours after. I found myself having to take out the kitchen waste, the aroma of spent grounds was so pungent to me.

I found it so off-putting that I'm wondering if I did something wrong. Do I just not like anaerobic coffee that much? Did I get too adventurous starting out? Is there some trick to brewing anaerobic that I missed? Are they all like that?","am I doing anaerobic wrong? new-ish to specialty coffee not from a grocery store so I'm still finding what I like.

"Beans with a ""soapy"" taste?","I was excited to receive a new bag of beans from a roaster I've had pleasant experiences with in the past, but I'm sorely disappointed by my latest. It's a medium-ish roast Colombian single origin, and it has this distinct bitterness that tastes... soapy. Note: It isn't an issue with my brew method or the cleanliness of my equipment, as these are the only beans that produce this flavor for me. 

Has anyone else had this experience? It doesn't taste like your typical overextracted bitterness - it really tastes like the bitterness you get from soap. There's a nice fruitiness at the onset, but then it finishes with the bitterness lingering. I imagine it's what people who don't like cilantro taste. Anyway, it's not something I'm concerned about or anything, just thought it was odd and wanted to share.","Beans with a ""soapy"" taste?

Disappointed about Espresso,"Hi everyone. I recently tried espresso for the second time today, and I didn't really enjoy it either time. Both times I've tried it have been at the same specialty-coffee-like cafe. It seemed quite unpleasant, and what I think might be astringent, though I'm not 100% sure what that means. I hoped the second time would allow my palate to grow accustomed to it, but seemingly no luck. In my mind this could be due to 1 of 3 different options:

1) My sense of taste isn't yet accustomed to the strong flavour, and I need some time to get used to espresso
2) I don't like espresso, and should stick to filter coffee and milk drinks
3) the cafe doesn't make very good espresso

I was wondering if anyone could give any advice to find out which it is, and what to do to enjoy espresso more (or whether I should give up trying!).

"how much difference will a ""midgrade"" coffee machine make?","Apologies for the formatting, I am on mobile. 

My question is as the title states. I am looking to spend about ~$100-$200 on a new coffee machine. Currently I have an Amazon basics machine that I am happy enough with, but my girlfriend has started drinking coffee with me in the mornings so I need a machine that is larger than 5 cups. I was blown away at the difference in flavour moving from a blade to a burr grinder both for my coffee and espresso, but I have never had a nice drip machine before. Anyone that has a nicer machine that I have used makes preground cheap coffee from it so I haven't been able to appreciate the machine's differences to my own. Will I experience as big of a shift as moving from blade to burr grinder when moving from my $20 coffee machine to one ten times its price?","how much difference will a ""midgrade"" coffee machine make?

Maple Flavored Drinks,"Good morning everyone,

I while back I got really into maple lattes after watching a coffee shop on tv who are known for them. I found the flavor combination to be delicious but when I tried remaking it myself I came across an issue, the maple flavor was to delicate you could hardly taste it and I only got the maple syrup flavor on the back end.

After some research, I found that the maple flavor comes from the darker syrups, not only the darker syrups but also syrups extracted from later in the season. I don't use artificial maple syrups and I wouldn't say I buy the top quality since it can get pricey.

This being said, I had the idea of maybe adding maple extract to maple syrup itself and then continuing to use it as a syrup for my lattes. Will this add a weird maple flavor to the latte or can this actually enhance the maple flavor of the syrup itself to make it a little more dominate in the final product? 

Thank you as always to everybody in the community and I hope to hear back","Maple Flavored Drinks Good morning everyone,

Americanos with the Breville Barista Express - how to get 500ml/16oz of coffee?,"I know this might not be the proper way to use the machine, but for my Barista Express I can never seem to get more than 4 oz or so of coffee, even in the manual and programmed modes.

This isn't producing as much coffee as I'd like it too, sometimes only making 1 single ounce before shutting off, which leaves my finished americanos weak.  
Running the same puck twice seems to solve the issue, but the second time around doesn't give the same high pressure.

It's almost like the machine isn't extracting all the potential coffee out of the puck the first time.

On my old machine, the Breville BarVista, I could keep the shot running as long as I'd like to, up to a minute or so, and never had any problems. I haven't found a way to do this on the Barista Express.

Anyone else find a way to keep the shots running as long as possible?

I'm also aware that an optimal shot would be around 25 seconds and produce roughly 38 grams of espresso for the 18 that I put in, but I want the BIG 500ml of coffee like I had before, with the same 18g of beans that I used before.

Even with this bottleneck, I'm finding the Barista Express to be a huge upgrade to the old Barvista that I had before.","Americanos with the Breville Barista Express - how to get 500ml/16oz of coffee?

Opening bakery serving coffee - filter only for the beginning? Or invest in espresso/training/staff etc.,"I'll be opening a small bakery in a UK city soon; an open plan bakery serving artisan bread, pastries, and sandwiches. Mainly takeout, with maybe 5-10 seats. And also serve coffee. My initial idea was to invest in a decent, lower end espresso machine (Conti CC100), grinder, batch brewer etc. My partner, who has worked as a barista for a few years, would be in charge of serving customers and making coffees. We did realise we'd have to probably hire someone else to help out in FoH. 

I'm now thinking, however, to only serve batch brew (for now). The thing is, I'd rather avoid the costs of an espresso set-up, the cost of hiring someone else to help at the front, and the possibility that the coffee might not always be the greatest because of time pressure. But with batch brew, my partner could serve, make cups of batch brew, and also help in the kitchen. No other employee needed. 

Of course, I'd make sure there's space to buy an espresso machine later on, when we're in a certain flow running the business, and we're in a position to hire more people. But for the beginning, I was thinking we could just focus on high quality filter, and give a choice of two roast types (light/medium) - of course having two batch brewers, which I think would still be cheaper than an espresso set up. 

Would love to hear some thoughts on this, especially from people who really know their coffee. Do you think people will stray away from coming if they know we don't serve espresso based drinks? Do you think the coffee scene is going towards filter?","Opening bakery serving coffee - filter only for the beginning?

Last feedback before I buy the 1Zpresso Q2,"Hello there,

I have the 1Zpresso Q2 in my basket and I’m ready to trigger it but I wanted to ask for some opinions before doing it.

I read quite a few posts here about it and looks like is a safe choice in the lower end of the premium manual grinders.

I brew all the methods but espresso, mainly pour over V60, between 12 to 18 grams on average. Some times moka, rarely french press, I might buy an aeropress at some point.

For me it’s a “middle” expense, I don’t mind too much, I would like the JX but it’s 1.5 the price (50€ more) and I don’t think I’m ready for that yet. 

Will the Q2 last a long time?
Will I regret not getting the JX?
Should I consider other alternatives? 

Thanks","Last feedback before I buy the 1Zpresso Q2 Hello there,

Cona Vintage Siphon - Standard Kitchen Model on a modern ceramic hob?,"I recently bought a vintage Cona coffee siphon - the standard kitchen model designed to be used on a stove top. The box includes artwork of the siphon being used on an older electric coil hob, and the instructions mention both electric and gas stoves, so they are clearly fine. 

I have a gas camping stove which I'm planning to use to test the siphon, but does anyone know how safe it would be to use the siphon on my electric ceramic (not induction) hob? 

I've tried to look around online and can't find many people discussing the Cona stove top models. I've seen a little discussion about Cory and Bodum models, but there don't seem to be any definitive answers. 

Some say it's fine to use directly on the hob, others say to buy a heat diffuser plate to ensure it heats the lower pot evenly, others say the pot will explode! 

I'd love to be able to use this regularly on my kitchen stove, but I don't want to damage this beautiful vintage siphon.

Crossland CC1 indicating much higher temperature than in reality (225F display vs 85F boiler temp) - anyone else run into this?,"I've had a Crossland CC1 for a few years. I've got the programmed temps at 200F and 208F (208-209F is boiling at my altitude) in the setup and a couple weeks ago I looked and saw the boiler temp at 225! I unplugged the machine and am just now getting around to troubleshooting - and the readout says 220-225F, but the actual temperature of the water is more like 85-90F.  
Has anyone encountered this, and how did you solve it? I thought it might be the thermistor, but that shouldn't be possible as the microprocessor/PID should never let the temp go that high. I opened the lid and there isn't any visible sign of damage. I can't read the markings on the thermistor (faded/smudged) so I can't look up the temp curve and test it. I would reset the firmware to default, but I didn't see a way to do that in the manual. 
I have reached out to Bill Crossland about this, but my last couple attempts to contact him haven't gotten any response (might be just going to spam), but I figured I'd ask here as well. 

Disclaimer - I'm very comfortable tinkering with microprocessors and sensors but I'm not an EE; unless you suggest grabbing a scope, I'm down to check or fix anything, down to (larger) discreet SMT chip replacement.","Crossland CC1 indicating much higher temperature than in reality (225F display vs 85F boiler temp) - anyone else run into this?

Is this grinder a good buy for the price? It is my first one.," Good afternoon everyone,

After I was no longer satisfied with the Nespresso coffee, I decided to search for a piston machine with a grinder. Since I am just new into this world, I don't want to spend too much money at this moment. Therefore I have decided to go for the Sage the Bambino plus as a machine.

I decided to go for the Eureka Mignon Specialita as a grinder. At first I wanted to buy a Sage grinder(because it was cheaper), but I understand now that a Eureka grinder is considerably better. Since I didn't want to spend too much money, I searched for this grinder on marketplace(from the Netherlands). Yesterday I came across the following ad:

[https://www.marktplaats.nl/v/witgoed-en-apparatuur/koffiezetapparaten/m1838051972-eureka-mignon-specialita-bonenmaler-chroom](https://www.marktplaats.nl/v/witgoed-en-apparatuur/koffiezetapparaten/m1838051972-eureka-mignon-specialita-bonenmaler-chroom)

The person concerned sells the grinder for 350 euros and indicates that he has been using it for 6 months (he bought it at Koffiewarenhuis.nl). Yesterday I bid 330 euros and he accepted it immediately. I can pick up the grinder tomorrow. I was wondering, before I finally buy it, if this is a good buy? I don't know anything about grinders yet, so I find it difficult to pass judgment on this. Tomorrow I can inspect the grinder before buying it, but I wouldn't know where to look at either. What strikes me is that the sticker which says specialita looks strange. It looks like it is about to fall off or that it has just been glued on. On new devices, but even on older devices, the stickers look much nicer and neater. Or am I totally wrong?  


Thank you very much for your help,  


Richard","Is this grinder a good buy for the price? It is my first one.  Good afternoon everyone,

After I was no longer satisfied with the Nespresso coffee, I decided to search for a piston machine with a grinder. Since I am just new into this world, I don't want to spend too much money at this moment. Therefore I have decided to go for the Sage the Bambino plus as a machine.

Pour-Over dedicated Hand Grinder,"Hello Folks,

Im kinda stuck. 
When i started out with Specialty Coffee - everything that came to my mind was espresso, cappuccino, long black and flat white. Which is why i got myself an Espresso Machine - the rest is history.
But I've really come to enjoy filter coffee in the last few months and that's where my problem starts!

Since Im currently using a DF64 as my dedicated espresso grinder (which i love btw) and noticing that it produces a lot of fines for the V60, which results in a muddier cup - I thought about buying a grinder solely for pour-over and especially V60!
My first choice would be something like a Fellow Ode with SSP MP Burrs - but that would be around 600€ here in Germany and that's kinda overkill, for my budget.

So my question(s) is/are: Do you think, that maybe something like a Commandante would suffice? Does it produce a better V60 Cup than a DF64? Or is a regular Fellow Ode V1.1 (even without SSP Burrs) ""better"" than a Commandante? For that matter, what actually is the Ode V1.1 Version and does it finally grind fine enough?

Im only drinking light roasts on pour over and love clean, sweet and juicy cups.

Thank you so, so much people!

No pressure when using a double shot basket,"I am new to using espresso machines and I can't seem to find anything online about this- The machine I'm using is a Sage(breville) barista express. When we first started using it, it all worked fine. Recently I have encountered an issue where whatever I do, regardless of grind size or amount of beans there is no pressure at all when using a double shot basket in the portafilter. I thought it may have been an issue with the machine, but have recently found out the single shot basket (not a pressurised basket) works perfectly. I thought I might have messed up the programming at some point so thought I'd try the double shot button using the single basket as a test, which again the pressure was perfect on. The only thing I can find about this is that the quality of beans might affect this, however this is a consistent issue. I have tried many beans including well known brands as well as locally roasted beans and there is always no pressure.

Is it possible that the double shot basket could be damaged in some way or bad quality as it isn't a reputable brand and was ordered on amazon? It worked fine the first few uses.

Thank you in advance if anybody had any ideas!","No pressure when using a double shot basket I am new to using espresso machines and I can't seem to find anything online about this- The machine I'm using is a Sage(breville) barista express.

Favourite Hario Switch Recipe,"Been messing around with the Hario switch lately and have come up with my favourite recipe and thought I'd share. It makes a balanced cup with alot of mouth feel and body, with the ability to tailor the sweetness and acidity to your taste.

&amp;#x200B;

I use a coarser grind closer to French Press, and 20g to 300g water.

&amp;#x200B;

I started out with the Tetsu 4:6 method, meaning the first two pours are with the switch open, and equal to 120g water. 60g, 60g to have balanced sweetness and acidity; slightly less (50g) first pour and more second pour (70g) for a sweeter brew; and finally slightly more (70g) first pour and slightly less (50g) second pour for a slightly more acidic brew.

&amp;#x200B;

Next I would close the switch and fill the remaining 180g of water and stir quite quickly with the end of a chopstick in a clockwise for about 45sec to fully saturate all the grinds in the water like a french press, after 45sec I press the switch and continue stirring in clockwise direction. You can do longer than 45sec for stronger coffee, shorter for weaker coffee.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm loving the switch!

Too much foam on my Espresso,"I am having problems getting a nice cup of coffee with specific beans.

They are rather lightly roasted and were roasted around maybe 3 weeks ago.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I have is that whenever I use those specific beans the Espresso comes out really foamy and fast, while all the other coffees used run just fine. (I like tasting many different beans) 

And whatever I change, grindsize or quantity, the shot will always be really foamy. I mean I can't even really call it Crema, if there is like 40-50% of the shot just really thick foam. 

&amp;#x200B;

I use 18 grams for a double shot, and getting out around 45g. The run through was around 28s fro this specific shot.

&amp;#x200B;

The picture shows a better shot of those I got, and it is still really foamy. The shot was sitting around for around 40-50 seconds.

I use a Gaggia Classic Pro, with a clipped spring, and a Sage (Breville) Smart Grinder Pro.

How to frequently change grind settings?,"I've been watching a lot of coffee/espresso content lately and I've learned a lot and grind definitely seemed to be one of the more difficult things to dial in.

My main question is this: how difficult is it when wanting to switch dramatically between grinds, and is it something I need to worry about? I like to enjoy a French press and pour overs, but I also am looking to buy my first espresso machine and get really sweaty with it. Will it make dialing in my espresso a lot harder if I'm constantly switching between super coarse and super fine between coffee types? Should I grab a super cheap manual grinder or whatever for my course grinds for pourovers and FP and keep my expensive one tuned in on what's working for my espresso?

Espressos / small cups - Nespresso or coffee beans/grinder?,"Firstly, if this topic has been explored previously, I would appreciate any links.

I drink three Nespresso coffee pods at the moment - espresso size. On the weekends, I occasionally do a V60 pourover with beans from a local cafe, for about 150-200 ml coffee ( I have them grind the beans for me at the moment).

Where I am:

- Nespresso pods are ~USD0.6 to USD0.8 a pod.
- A 200-225g of coffee beans is about USD9 to USD16 a bag.
- I am the only coffee drinker at home - so unsure whether I can use a bag of beans before they ""expire"".
- I am usually in a rush in the morning, so time efficiency is important during the week (I also keep a Nespresso machine at work for the afternoon pick me up).

I am interested in buying a beans grinder and making more espressos that way, learning more about coffee etc. However I am unsure whether it will just end up being a waste of money, given time cost / financial cost / coffee expiring before I finish it - and whether I am just thinking about this because I'm bored with Nespresso at the moment... 

Does anyone have any thoughts about the above, particularly whether it is cost and time efficient to make espresso at home (when compared to Nespresso), and if there are any good guides for how to do so?

However, then something strange happened. I heard a hissing noise, so I thought ""a dang, I somehow didn't seal the pot properly, but the sound wasn't coming from the mid-section. Instead, the sound was coming from the bottom. I lifted up the moka pot and I noticed 2 bubbles of steams coming from the bottom. I wiped the bubbles but they came back. After I let the pot cool down, I inspected the bottom and found that tiny black dots showed up on the spots where the bubbles formed.

Is this what I think it is? Did I receive a Moka pot (from the official Bialetti online store) with inherit faults in the bottom of the pot? I can't find anything on Google describing this problem so I wanted to check if anyone had this experience before? (Yes, I've contact Bialetti customer service but it's a public holiday so no response).","Leaky bottom of Moka pot Hello Coffee lovers,

Anyone broken a Niche zero?,"I have read mumbling a about “well it’s new so we don’t know how reliable it will be long term”. Has anyone broken one? Did you fix it? I’m in the USA so how was getting parts (or support) from the UK?

I’m thinking of side/up-grading from a Mazzer Super Jolly for three reasons: lower retention (doesn’t bother me much, I single dose and clean fairly regularly), slightly less counter real estate (doesn’t matter much but would be nice), and to be able to do more non-espresso brewing without as much trouble. 

If someone has a benchmark of using a Niche for say a small office (5-10 drinks a day) long term (2+ years?) that would probably be an interesting data point. I’m 2-3 drinks a day so could reasonably say “that’ll last me 10+ years”.  I’m probably under a pound a week every week.","Anyone broken a Niche zero?

Calling all coffee shop/cafe owners!,"Hello coffee fam. I am thinking about opening a coffee shop in an urban city (Oakland). I wouldn't say the location is the best, due to lack of packing and lack of complimentary adjacent shops. However, I was given an opportunity through my business partner to give this a go. Rent will be below market rate for the first three years, which is great because I understand this is a huge fixed costs that can burden new shops. I have coffee and managing experience and will be working at the shop as well.

It's a huge space for a coffee shop/cafe, as it is over 2,500 sq. feet. Along with coffee, I plan to sell food (toasts, sandwiches and salads with add-on protein options) to increase average ticket price. 

For those who keep your shops open late into the evening, I would love to hear how you're making it work as I understand most people stop drinking caffeine early/late afternoon and most shops close around 3-5PM. 

Also, if you guys have any advice or tips, please feel free to share (DM is open too). Thank you!","Calling all coffee shop/cafe owners! Hello coffee fam.

About brazilian arabica roasts,"I'm from Brazil and i've get to know a lot of brazilians arabica coffees, but i don't really know how far the rabbit hole goes to the quality coffee being produced around here. Recently i tried Jacu bird coffee and i really think it was a very nice cup of coffee, almost no bitterness (if any) and very pleasant overall. But since i tried this one i cannot stop thinking that the arabica coffee i find at supermakets are in a mid tier quality, they have some bitterness (which is usually not ideal), alongside other traits like nice acidity, sweetness, body, etc.

I think it is possible to find way better coffees around here though i'm unable to find any reliable sources. Have any of you tried nice brazilian beans? Which ones?

I personally prefer fruit-like acidity (citric), and some natural sweetness to the roast.","About brazilian arabica roasts I'm from Brazil and i've get to know a lot of brazilians arabica coffees, but i don't really know how far the rabbit hole goes to the quality coffee being produced around here.

"A combo of espresso focused electric grinder + cheaper hand grinder for pour over, opinions ?","Hi everyone,   
I'm looking to buy a new  grinder, I don't have much of experience in that regard as I only owned an encore before, and I mainly drink espresso daily but maybe twice a week a v60 or a french press. 

Originally I intended on buying a niche zero as I think it is perfect for me with it's low retention, grind quality and the overall aesthetics. However shipping it to Germany where I live will cause a price overhead, I think it would cost around 700 to 750 euro (shipping, customs...etc) instead of the original price based on some forums and that makes me wonder is it still worth it at this price point.  
As an alternative I'm looking into these two possible scenarios:

1. A premium hand grinder for both styles like the Kinu m47 (but not sure which variant to get though) or 1Zpresso (I don't know why they have soo many variants and also don't know which to pick.) or maybe Helor 101...etc
2. An espresso focused electric grinder like the Sette 270 + something like the Knock Aergrind for pour over  


My budget for this is around 500 euro, I single dose my coffee every time, and I don't mind hand grinders. so what is your opinion? any worthy grinders I should take a look at better than the above ones? or even a better way to approach this?","A combo of espresso focused electric grinder + cheaper hand grinder for pour over, opinions ?

A person who hasn't drunk coffee looking for suggestions,"Hi,

I'll start with saying that I have never drunk coffee. I had maybe 5 cups altogether. Now, my parents just got a milk frother and I tried a cappuccino. Surprisingly for me, it wasn't half bad.

Well, then I somehow ended up here (whoopsies) and what I found piqued my interest.

Long story short, I decided to try to learn more about coffee and figure out if it is a beverage I find tasty or not. Tom Scott's video with James Hoffman suggest that it might be possible.

What would you recommend me to try? Perhaps an aeropress to begin with, and get ground coffee from a local shop? As I am not sure about this new thing, which caught my interest, I would like to refrain from spending much money (at least before I decide whether I like it or not).

I'll be grateful for any recommendations.","A person who hasn't drunk coffee looking for suggestions Hi,

Curious about these extraction yield results I'm getting. Darker roasts with same brew parameters as light are getting a lower extraction yield...,"The roastery I work at are checking our extraction yields for all of our coffees. We recently had some trouble with our 20kg roaster and we've noticed what seemed like underextraction in a lot of our brews so we're checking our EY. Sure enough, we're getting extractions in the 17.5% range for most of our coffees outside of a couple so far in our testing.   


We're using a Fetco batch brewer with 2.5 liter batch sizes and the exact same brew temp and recipe across the board just to see how everything stacks up. 1:16 ratio.  6:30 total brew time. 200F water tank.   


So we have a dark roast that had an extraction yield of 17.7% and then we have two light roasts that are getting 18.9% and 18.3%. The same origin as the dark roast roasted at a medium got a 17.1%. How is it possible that a dark roast is getting a lower extraction yield than light roasts? I understand different origins can be more or less soluble at the same roast level, but a light and dark being that far apart seems odd.   


Most coffees are testing at a TDS of between 1.35% and 1.5% which seems low also for a 1:16 ratio.

"Need help to choose a machine, ideally 2 types of beans","Hi all,

I decided to stop using my nespresso machine, but I struggle to find what I want to buy. I'll work from home, and on most days I think I drink three coffees, like one lungo coffee in the morning, one capuccino after lunch and a macchiatto in the afternoon. I also drink some shorter espresssos sometimes, but actually I mostly take them in restaurants, or after a dinner with friends. I drink my coffee with some sugar and a bit of milk usually.

&amp;#x200B;

I've a very basic semi-automatic delonghi machine in my other house, where I enjoy drinking some good specialty coffee. My budget is about 800 to 1000$ ideally (I'm in switzerland, so it's roughtly the same in chf).

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that having access to two different beans would be a good solution, so I could have like a specialty coffee for the espressos and lungos, and another (probably cheaper) coffee for the capuccino's and machiatto's, where using very high end coffee on a daily basis would probably be a waste. But unfortunately it seems it's pretty rare to have that feature. From what I saw with this, I found:

\- Mostly the Melitta T Smart or TS, which are pretty similar. I think I found the TS for roughly the same price so would go for this. My issue with this is that as the coffee goes through the same grinder, there would be some leftovers, and if I alternate espresso and a capuccino from both bean selectors, I'll always have a mix of them. And if I need to make a ""empty coffee"" between each, I'll lose so much that it's not worth it, and lose much time

\- Siemens Eq.9 S 700. Looks perfect, but much more expensive. Found a good second hand one but it was sold when I asked again about it. And not sure I really want to spend 1k on a machine with no warranty...

Jura giga 6 , Delonghie maestosa are out of budget.

&amp;#x200B;

I could also simply lose that feature, and go for any good machine (delonghi primadonna or dynamica plus seem good, etc) that also take ground coffee and use that for the machiattos, but it looks a bit like a waste.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I want a fully automatic bean to cup machine to keep it easy. Is there really a big difference of quality with the semi-automatic ones?

Office machine options (help)?,"I have recently been promoted to manage a modest office of 18 people. We have suffered through many years of terrible coffee from local coffee supply vendors. It has been your standard Bunn coffee maker to an airpot like you’d see in every office. Coffee choices have not been good. Many people, myself included stopped drinking it unless necessary. We have recently moved locations and have a chance to start fresh.  I’d like to help boost morale with a nice machine and the ability to purchase local beans. I’ve found bette vendors locally but we would still be locked into say Starbucks or a local roaster with good coffee but again we are stuck with just a couple options if we choose to use a coffee service vendor. 

Having the freedoms to buy from any roaster we chose doesn’t seem to be an option with the vendors, as I’m assuming they make some of their money on the coffee itself. I’m nervous about investing in a machine without the backing of someone that will fix it if it breaks.

Coffee help for a coffee newbi,"Hi!

Would you buy 1l french press to do a couple of cups?

"After making a batch of cold brew coffee concentrate, is there any negative implications to storing it in the fridge at full concentration?","Hey y’all! I had a question about the storage of cold brew coffee. 

My boyfriend and I love making cold brewed coffee at home. We have always preferred our coffee iced vs hot, especially in the summer. Making it ourselves saves a lot of money, which we need to be especially mindful of right now.

The recipe I use calls for a ratio of 8oz of coffee per 8 cups of water. When it is prepared, it is diluted with 1 cup of ice and 1/2 cup of water.

From what I’ve read, the cold brew concentrate can be stored up to two weeks. What I’m wondering is- does it have to be stored in its concentrated form? Will it lose any flavor if it is stored in its final diluted form? 

My boyfriend and I are both guilty of going a little heavy on the concentrate. While I’d like to say we should work on our compulsiveness, that’s easier said than done at 8am in the morning.","After making a batch of cold brew coffee concentrate, is there any negative implications to storing it in the fridge at full concentration?

First coffee grinder purchase,"For the past year or so I 've been using a subscription service to deliver ground coffee or beans every two weeks. They come in 250gr bags with a valve and the coffe is roasted and ground one day before delivery. 

At some point I bought ground coffee from my favourite local spot to use for V60. The first few cups were excellent and tasted pretty close to the batch brew from the shop but after 3 days or so the magic was lost and although it was still tasty, the shop made better cups (I even used the same water as them!).

Long story short it's time purchase a burr grinder. I only brew drip coffee at home so was eyeing the Commandante hand grinder or the Fellow Ode. Then I saw that Hario also sells a very cheap hand grinder, around £25.

Behmor Brazen+ ... Thin brew on just two cups,"I've had this thing eight years... and have learned the dialed-in the settings that work. I get consistently good results... except when I decide to make just two cups. It comes out a bit thin &amp; under-extracted. It works great for a full-four or 3/4-load for three cups.

I have tried:

* Increasing the coffee dose
* Settling and slightly compressing the bed of grounds

Looking for a brewing method for 3 people traveling,"I looked around and seen a couple options, one of which was an aeropress. Seems like a fantastic solution if you're traveling alone, it can only really yield a single serving per press. The brew time is quick but having to rinse it and replace the filter would get annoying after 5 or so pressings.

I also looked at a coleman thermos french press. It brews 16oz, double what the aeropress can do. 

Any suggestions on a method of making larger amounts of coffee in a reasonably compact manner without flame?

Machine: Russell Hobbs Luna Filter Coffee Maker

I use the 1x4 brown Melitta filters as the basket that comes with the coffee maker is terrible for letting grounds through.

Coffee: Lavazza Rossa Grounds (I don't have a bean grinder)

I've been trying to play around with the 1:16 ratio, so for example the last cup i made was 240ml (about 8oz) and i used 16 grams of grounds and it seems almost bitter? Same result when using 14-16g coffee grounds, which were grounded recently and only opened 2 days ago.

The instructions on my machine advise that ""the reservoir is calibrated to give 12 large cups (at 125ml per cup), and for each large cup, add 6g of ground filter coffee..
I tried this and it was quite weak so i can't seem to find the middle ground..

Unrelated but the hotplate on the machine only stays on for 45 minutes at a time which really sucks having to remember to keep getting up to turn it back on!

"Super-automatic uses about 150g/L (1:7 ratio) for ""normal strength coffee""?!","I have access to an older DeLonghi Ecam machine and wanted to see if I can manage to brew coffee that I like. For taste comparison I brewed the same coffee in an AeroPress and as pour-over to my liking. All good.

The machine's version was more acidic and lacked flavor. Temperature was already at its maximum setting, so I adjusted grind size to as fine as the machine could handle without stalling and obvious channeling. The result was more flavorful and had less pronounced acidity. While it was still far away from the AeroPress and pour-over, the taste was much improved. Definitely the right direction.

I wondered how much coffee the machine used. Maybe it used less and this caused the weakness. Again, for comparison I made an AeroPress with 60g/L (1:17 ratio). I measured both how much coffee I got out and weighed the completely dried puck.

On to the machine. I made a coffee (not ""espresso"") with its ""normal strength"" setting, measured the output, dried the puck (yes, I emptied the container before) and weighed the completely dried puck. I then calculated g/L, or the ratio, for both brews.

Result: The machine used about 2.5 times as much coffee. Roughly 150g/L or about a 1:7 ratio for ""coffee"".

* Is this normal or is the machine defective?
* Is the machine's design only capable to extract such a tiny fraction of the flavor compared to other brewing methods due to temperature, grind size, contact time, etc.?
* Any idea how I could have invalidated my little experiment?

Side notes:

* If caffeine has high and fast solubility, that's a lot of caffeine.

Moccamaster KBT questions,"Greetings! 

I have been brewing on a 6 cup Chemex for about 7 years, and am considering switching to a 10 cup Moccamaster KBT for my week day brewing for a few reasons (less involved brewing, more capacity, etc). But, I have a few questions  before pulling the trigger:

1.  I love the coffee I am making with my Chemex. Am I correct in thinking that I won’t be disappointed with the Moccamaster? 

2. Can it produce a full 40 oz of coffee? 

3. How well does the thermal carafe insulate the coffee? Does it fully seal up like a travel mug, or is there always an opening? I ask because I usually brew coffee for myself and my partner in the morning, but she doesn’t usually drink hers until about 2-3 hours after it has been brewed. Would the carafe keep a half pot hot enough vs using a travel mug of some sort? 

I was also considering trying to grab a refurbished one, if any one has any experience with that.

Is 2 grams too much in terms of scale inaccuracy?,"I recently bought what supposedly is a scale similar to Hario, but I am a bit disappointed on it's accuracy. It seems to approximate a lot, and I've even managed to get it confused with a margin of error of around 2 grams.

Best In-Office Setup for 1 Person in Terrible Coffee Workplace,"Hi!  I have what may be a bit of an oddity here.  I'm changing jobs and my new workplace has really bad coffee, think a large, musty automatic machine.

Gaggia Steam Wand Upgrade,"Hello r/Coffee!

I just swapped out the steam wand on my gaggia classic from the Rancilio Silvia steam wand (v2, I think?) to the wand from the gaggia classic pro. Long story short, I now have a perfectly functional steam wand already set up to go into a gaggia classic. Since I don’t need it, I thought someone out there might have a gaggia classic in need of an upgrade.

If you want it, it’s yours — I’ll ship it anywhere in the US/Canada. DM me and we can sort out the details.  All I ask is that you be kind and only ask for it if you’re going to use it, I’d rather not ship it out just to have it sit in someone else’s drawer.

First come first serve. If someone claims it, I will post an edit here letting everyone know it’s taken. Dear mods, if this post violates any rules please let me know and I will happily take it away.","Gaggia Steam Wand Upgrade Hello r/Coffee!

Coffee Equipment Rubber Sour Smell,"I had this problem with my Aeropress a while back. The first few brews were great, but the rubber seal developed a very sour and unpleasant smell, which resulted in the brews tasting fun as well. I ordered another seal from a different manufacturer with a high user rating and good reviews, still, after only a day or 2 it developed the same awful sour rubber smell.  
I posted about it on r/Aeropress and they told me to try not washing it with soap. Well, a third seal is on it's way, but in the meantime I received my Hario Switch yesterday. It too has developed the same disgusting sour rubber coffee smell on the rubber base. I haven't used soap on it ever, and I got it just yesterday.  
At this point I'm left to conclude something is happening between the water, coffee, and the rubber. I have noticed my main problem that occurs with any method is too acidic coffee. I can make an acceptable brew in a French Press, or Pour-Over, but once the rubber is involved it's pretty much impossible. Even several of the cafe's in my town I find the coffee to be far too acidic.  
So I'm guessing it's a water issue, or at least the water is a big factor. The water is very hard here 400-600ppm). I tried a zero water filter, which lasted less than 2 days. That simply is not viable for me. I've ordered some water ph strips so I'll see tomorrow how that turns out.  
I'm willing to settle for the best I can do with hard water, but the acidity seems to be a persistent problem, and using the rubber equipment makes it undrinkable.  
The coffee beans are good, the soap is not the issue. I've tried cleaning the rubber with vinegar, baking soda, soap, peroxide, sunshine etc (separately).  
I guess what I'm wondering is if any of you here have experienced a similar issue, and hopefully have a solution to the water acidity, a method to clean the nastiness out of the rubber, or some information about something I'm missing here.","Coffee Equipment Rubber Sour Smell I had this problem with my Aeropress a while back.

Help Me Improve My Office Coffee Situation,"I work in a medium-sized legal office (10-20 people) and we have sort of a typical coffee setup:  zojirushi thermoses, a large coffee brewer, and pre-ground, pre-packaged starbucks coffee.

 We have a couple thermoses, usually one is the blonde roast and the other is a darker roast.

Latin beans are solid cups. African beans are wine. Asian, ehhhh.  

I’ve noticed this too in multiple roasters in Russia, Germany, and UK. Very little Asian selection.

"""The best part is no part"": Cupping gave me my favorite coffee and I added a decanting step to have it cleaner","TL, DR at the bottom.

We have a best-for-budget auto dripper at home, which uses paper filters. I'm not against it, since it's extremely easy to use. Otherwise, my sister probably wouldn't brew her coffee. And I also benefited from it for years. Especially for straining cold brew coffee...

But it's filtering the coffee too much. I guess those extremely fine grounds that only paper filter can strain gives a taste I prefer.

The machine also somehow has moods and it never brews the same coffee twice, I think, but that's a different story 🤣

Thanks to James Hoffman, I learned about cupping, after benefiting from his french press video. I don't usually test coffee, but after trying test comparison between a few cups, I noticed that the cups had actually drinkable coffee. There was a large sediment at the bottom, of course, but if I just drink the liquid layer, it was actually a normal and enjoyable coffee.

Recently, I started to brew only with this. It's extremely easy, almost as easy as instant coffee. And it tastes significantly better than the paper filter, for my taste. And no additional dishes to wash, unlike french press with a difficult to clean fine mesh.

I also liked to brew with Turkish coffee method before. It was similar, meaning no straining. But decanting(pouring very slowly) the coffee with the Turkish coffee pot(jazwa) gave unexpectedly clean cups. Even better than french press sometimes.

So I'm now mixing this with cupping. I have a glass tea brewing pot with a large bottom. So it's very suitable for decanting.

https://i.imgur.com/iCqrdHs.jpeg

I pour the coffee into the cup, after mixing it slowly at 4 mins. I don't want to disturb fine grounds that would settle later, so I let them settle in the cup, instead of the pot. They are not too much, so this doesn't concern me.

I sometimes use a coarse strainer during pouring, just to catch the floating coarse grounds and chaffs. But it's not necessary.

The cups are significantly cleaner than cupping alone. And even though I dirtied one additional dish, the glass pot is very easy to clean. I'm really enjoying this method now.

TL, DR: I like the things in the coffee that the paper filters strain. I also like simpler methods(thus, ""the best part is no part""). So I started brewing with cupping and it was what I was looking for. Then I started brewing in a large bottom tea pot (the image/link above) and slowly pouring into the cup, and this simple addition gave significantly cleaner cups, while still being simple. So I'm really enjoying this method above other methods.

Ps: I made an electric screwdriver adapter for my Porlex grinder 🤣 I don't know if it will heat the grounds too much, but it's being fine for one cup grinding.

Note that I made a lower quality adapter years ago but the tolerances were too bad and it didn't last long. So I used Torx head and tight tolerances this time, and it's going well. The screw bit was a bit rusty, so I did hot bluing and cooled it in leftover sunflower oil, that I was using for season coating pans. So it probably also has a thin polymer coating. I think it will be rust free now.

How do you guys put away your premium hand grinder?,"This is perhaps a non-issue to a lot of you, but I find it really inconvenient that a lot of the greats come with the lid attached to the crank. I can see that its better this way for the sake of function, but it really isn't ideal for storage or traveling.

And if you chose to store it with the lid on, then takes up too much space and having that stainless steel crank in free fall isn't ideal either. So, how do you guys go about it?

It's crazy that out of all the big players, Timemore is the only one who tried to fix this issue with their collapsible cranks, but they're only available on one or two models so far.

What is the best price-quality coffee machine?,"Hey!

So I've been drinking coffee from my Nespresso machine for years. But it's not as good as I'd expect, and the capsules are getting very expensive. So I want to buy my own speciality coffee from coffee shops I like and make good expressos to drink alone or with milk.

Any ideas on what coffee machine I could buy? Not so expensive... but good for the price. 

Thanks!","What is the best price-quality coffee machine? Hey!

Upgrading from Encore grinder. Is the Ode by Fellow the way to go?,"I’ve seen Hoffman’s videos, and searched this sub a fair amount. But I wanted to solicit some suggestions before I order. 

The encore stinks. I know it’s the darling of this sub, but the grind is terribly inconsistent. I get microscopic bits and then huge boulders. 

Customer support said “you can send it back if you want. But actually, inconsistently sized grounds is good.” Sure. 

Plus it’s too loud. 

If I’m ok spending up to $500, is the Ode my best bet? I will use it for drip, never espresso. Thanks.","Upgrading from Encore grinder. Is the Ode by Fellow the way to go? I’ve seen Hoffman’s videos, and searched this sub a fair amount. But I wanted to solicit some suggestions before I order.

Best Before Dates - Rant and Question,"So last fall, my favorite local roaster passed away.  He was a great guy and an amazing roaster.  I never had to worry about roasting dates, everything was always very fresh.  Just the opposite, he would often advise me things like: ""I just roasted that on Tuesday, I would give it two more days to de-gas"".

So now I'm on the hunt for a new local roastery and I have found a few that are good, but not great.  I've been ordering bags from a number of places and have noticed that while the better places will put a ""Roasted On"" date, others will have the dreaded ""Best Before"" date.

We've probably beaten to death the uselessness of these dates but I've noticed something new.  A roaster who used to put a BB date that was four months after the roast date is now specifying a date that is six months out.  I thought that was lame until I ordered some beans from another local roaster and they were labeled with a BB date that was 5.5 months out.

Is a six month window a thing now?  I get that it is challenging to maintain stock in supermarkets, but this makes it really hard to know when the coffee was roasted.  What are you guys seeing out there?","Best Before Dates - Rant and Question So last fall, my favorite local roaster passed away.  He was a great guy and an amazing roaster.

How many of you also like to drink coffee at night?,"Hello everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I had to work late at night. Basically, I had to do it for a couple of nights. I had no other options except to take some work home and finish all the reports at night after dinner when everyone was asleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, I find working at nocturnal hours very satisfying -- you are on your own, no one bothers you, and you can focus on work without getting distracted by any other problems, text messages, and phone calls. You are just on your own with your thoughts and your work. Sometimes, I look in the window or go on the terrace at my house for a small break. Before that, I brew a delightful coffee. Recently, I've got a coffee press. I didn't want to wake everyone around with our noisy espresso machine. It also makes a good coffee, but the noise wakes everyone before the delightful scent reaches them.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm trying to master the skill of making a delightful coffee in a French press. I'm doing pretty well so far. I even noticed that coffee prepared in a French press is more aromatic than an espresso machine coffee. Maybe the technique plays a key role in the brewing process, or our espresso machine is a bit outdated. Who knows, but this aroma used to wake my family at night. Still, I try to be quiet and careful because I like to watch the starry sky and enjoy my drink.

&amp;#x200B;

But, this coin has another side. I struggle to fall asleep when I'm done with the work with all this caffeine. Then I struggle to wake up at night. Everything is twisted for me right now, and I feel lost when it is day and time to go to sleep. I know that the best solution is to consume less caffeine. I'm asking for some decaf sorts of coffee but with a pleasant taste and aroma. I wonder how many of you also like to drink coffee at night?","How many of you also like to drink coffee at night?

Decaffeinating immersion with activated charcoal,"I've always been a decaf drinker in my craft coffee journey, and while there's a lot of good decaf out there, it's nice to be able to try out whatever offering catches your eye. So I thought, water process decaf uses carbon filters to remove caffeine out of the first pass of beans, why not try it on a smaller scale?

PSA: Of course, be careful about timing with medications. The filter does a good job of catching most of the particles, but running water through will give it a murky tinge. Make sure what you need is already in your blood stream before  ingesting activated charcoal. The packaging on mine says wait one hour.

Into the Hario Switch 03:

20g beans

bit less than 1/8 tsp activated charcoal powder

360ml water, swirled after 1 minute and released

It tastes the same as the 10g cup I brew with my size 01 cone, and my heart isn't threatening to yeet out of my chest. Trying out a pour over tomorrow morning. I expect a lesser degree of decaffeination, but half caff is \]still better than full caff.

"Looking to start a mobile coffee cart in California, please help!","Now I know what you are thinking, why would I start a mobile coffee cart in California considering the enormous amount of fees, permits, laws, regulations, required to make it happen. I want to see if this is even possible for my situation to begin with.

I own a small coffee company in the Bay Area of California. We currently sell coffee bags but are looking to expand into a mobile cart. We would like to build a utility cart into a setup that sells ready to drink drip coffee and cold brew, accompanied with oat and almond milk in a Zojirushi pot, with extra plant-based milk in a cooler full of ice. We don't want to bring any dairy because of the risk of it spoiling and not having the necessary permits. Dairy is more of a liability than anything for our setup. 

As far as preparing the coffee goes, we would like to use commercial perculators to prepare large amounts of drip coffee that we will fill into a 5 gallon cambro. Cold brew would be prepared in a large Toddy cold brew bucket, and we would fill it into another 5 gallon cambro. Oat milk and almond milk would be setup ready to pour in a Zojirushi pot, and syrups, sugars, napkins, stirrers will be ready to go in case someone wants them. 

I know I need to obtain a seller's permit, health permit, and vehicle permit for my cart. My biggest question is can I get away with brewing the coffee in my own kitchen? People often use commercial kitchens when it comes to preparing food but coffee is something that can be so simply made your own house. 

Also, if I build my cart using a utility cart and simply sell ready to pour coffee, will I need a handwashing sink? California is one of those states that has the most insane laws when it comes to any type of mobile food setup.

Breville Barista Pro vs. Barista Touch?,"Hi! I am definitely not a coffee aficionado but I like a very strong, creamy latte. I’ve started from a drip machine, Keurig to a French press, a nespresso w/ milk frother, and have tried my fair share of expensive automatic machines which I haven’t been too fond of. I am looking to take my coffee experience up a notch. I’ve heard good things about the Breville Barista Pro and was wondering if those who’ve used it like it better than the touch? I’ve heard the touch doesn’t have hot enough temperature so I was thinking of just staying at the pro level. Any suggestions? For a while I was also considering the Philips Latte Go but being completely automatic it seemed less reliable/inherently clean than a semi. What I’m looking for:

6-cup bialetti moka producing tiny amount of coffee. what am I doing wrong?,"Hello!
Have always drank filter coffee and trying a moka pot for the first time, but 30g of coffee and about 300ml of water are producing barely enough coffee for two people to share out of my 6-cup moka pot. It was a 'like new' unit from Amazon but seems literally spotless.

I'm following the guide produced by James Hoffman, so I'm following his process, stopping the brew at the first signs of sputtering:

.I'm filling the basket of My 6-cup moka pot with freshly ground coffee (not too fine) and topping it off without packing it down. 
.I'm filling the boiler with boiling water to just below the valve, assembling the pot and sticking it on a low-medium gas heat. 
.I'm watching the pot, and as it begins to produce a steady stream of coffee I turn the heat to low. 
.When it begins to sputter, I remove from heat and run the unit under cold water until sputtering stops.

The pot is way less than half filled with coffee at this point, and splitting it between two normal coffee mugs (from the UK for reference) produces what I'd describe as two puddles of coffee. With milk, it makes two half-mugs of strong, tasty coffee. When cleaning the unit, it seems like half the water is still in the boiler, and murky brown.

What is going wrong here? If this was a two pot machine I'd say happy days, but the idea of spreading this amount of coffee across six servings is... Well, it can't be possible, unless Italian coffee is traditionally served via Petrie dish. Am I some kind of cultureless moron serving out two triple strength coffees? Are Italian cups a lot smaller than I think they are?

Or am I doing something stupid that is causing the pot to spurt way earlier than it should? I inspect the grounds afterwards and there is no sign of channeling and all the grounds are moist. I checked the gasket too, it seems in good shape- the metal filter it is holding in place is loose enough to rotate but does not wobble.

I've tried the pot about eight times now trying not to vary my method, and have produced the same results every time so far.

Thanks to anyone that could point me in the right direction with this, even if it is 'expect less coffee'!","6-cup bialetti moka producing tiny amount of coffee. what am I doing wrong? Hello!

What do do with store bought coffee?,"Hi all,

As the post says, I've recently got into the coffee rabbit hole, and I appreciate my coffee grind based on the preparation method I'm using that day. My siblings, bless their souls, thought to give me coffee for my birthday and decided to gift me 3 pounds of ""Specialty"" coffee which smells amazing, but came pre-ground to a very unfortunate grind size. The grind is way finer than a medium grind I'd use for V-60, but not nearly fine enough for espresso. I'm getting ridiculous draw down times when brewing in V-60 (7-8 min for 500ml) and ridiculously low times when doing espresso (10-15 sec for 30ml). 

I really don't want to chuck it, so I'm wondering if any of you have any good ideas on what to do with that amount of unfortunately ground coffee.

Need help picking a grinder for my parents :'),"I know nothing about grinders(hand grind user), I noticed the other day my folks are having some problems with their current grinder. I want some suggestion for an upgrade.

I don't know my budget yet cause I live in SEA so everything's kinda expensive, usually I tailor my budget towards the feature set of a machine. So something like a mid-tier grinder would be the best. They're not a fan of manual grinders so an electric is the way to go. They also brew espresso, but I would like to have a machine that is be able to grind for both espresso and filtered. My folks are pretty lazy when it comes to grinding when they need to so something with a basket to hold the beans would help get good tasting coffee, since they complain a lot about how the coffee tastes muddy all the time.

Help dialing in . . . grind?,"I have two brewing methods: when I just want a pot and don't care too much, I use a Moccamaster KBG. When I do care, I use a Chemex. But the coffee coming out of the Chemex is just barely better than the Moccamaster. 

Chemex process basically goes as follows:

* Grind (60g/litre) on Fellow Ode, setting one notch up from 4.
* Boil water in gooseneck kettle (water is soft, and run through under-sink Glacier Bay single stage filter, though I've tried distilled + Third Wave to the same effect)
* Rinse bleached paper Chemex filter, pour out water
* Add grinds, bloom ~1 minute
* Follow Chemex process from Stumptown

What results is inevitably kind of muddy and cardboardy and hints at brightness and complex flavors, but mostly just tastes like hot brown.

Here's what's killing me: I know something I'm doing is wrong. I went home to see family this weekend, and stopped at a place that serves the best goddamn coffee I've ever had. It's bright and clear the tasting notes are obvious. I bought those exact beans, roasted less than a week ago. I tried my method, and it *sucks* compared to what was drinking there.

Moccamaster: KBG Select vs. Cup one for a 300ml brew,"Hi folks, I'm about to buy a Moccamaster filter coffee machine but I'm not quite sure whether the KBG select or the Cup One is the better choice. 

I'm the only one drinking coffee at home and I always drink about 250 ml to 300ml per cup, so the Cup One would be perfect. But I'm not quite sure whether the shower head with multiple holes in the KBG Select is superior to the head in the Cup One with only one hole. 

Is it possible to brew a good 300 ml cup with the KBG Select, when I choose the mode for smaller batches and maybe grind a bit finer?

I am so confused! Isn’t 17g for 1 cup too much??,"
I want to move on from instant coffee to French press. But as I research more, I am surprised to find out that 17-20g of ground coffee is standard for 250-300ml water. Don’t people use only 5-7 grams max of instant coffee in 250 ml milk. Even that seems a little bitter.","I am so confused! Isn’t 17g for 1 cup too much??

How to increase water flow through the filter in filter coffee machine,"Hello.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a filter coffee machine with which I have this issue: I fill the filter about half full and the water tank full, start brewing coffee, and soon the inflow of water to the filter is greater than what passes the filter, causing the water to overflow the filter and the ground coffee spills over to the cup holding the filter, and often the ground coffee spills over to the brewed coffee too. [Here's couple of pictures](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hl1eg5mphldfolc/AABraX2o2c3MhzmOdkcXC-YRa?dl=0) of how it looks like afterwards.

The way I see it I either need to reduce the inflow of water, or increase the time water uses to pass the filter. The latter is likely the place to start. 

The flow of water through the filter is heavily redeced by the filter, to a - I believe - much greater extent than my previous filter coffee machines, so it seem like there's something about the design of the cup holding the filter causing the water to pass through very slowly. 

So, is there a way to increase the rate of which the water flows through the coffee filter?","How to increase water flow through the filter in filter coffee machine Hello.

Breville Bambino (non-Plus) PSA + Review (as a filthy casual),"**PSA**: The thing comes with a milk pitcher and non-pressurized basket now. I know that was only a thing on the Plus before, but I picked mine up from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and was surprised to see both included with it. A 16oz Milk pitcher and 4 baskets (2 pressurized, 2 non-pressurized). 

**Review**

After researching the big bois like the Rancilio &amp; Gaggia Classic, gotta say it feels amazing not to spend that much money on those. PID and instant startup were the big features that got me not to buy those two. The moment people started talking about ""temperature surfing"" I was out, all I care about is a pretty nice cup of coffee with milk and a little sugar, iced or hot. 

Took like 9 failed batches with the Breville Smart Grinder but I finally got it dialed in. The espresso tastes great! I don't drink it straight, either Americano or Latte. I tried to take that plastic part of the portafilter off but I just couldn't, but the coffee tastes fine and no weird plastic taste. I was thinking of getting those expensive tamp/distributors, but honestly that cheap-ass plastic tamp that comes with it works just fine. 

The steam wand is loud AF, sounds like hellspawn being fried alive by the sun and screaming for mercy. I can't tell if it's just my bad technique or I'll have to deal with that every time I froth milk, but it seriously hurts my ears. My dog hates it lol. 

Honestly from a convenience standpoint, this thing is amazing and I don't see myself upgrading for years. The fact that I can roll out of bed and make an espresso within the next 5 mins is insane. I know r/espresso probably hates me but to those who are stressing out over your next machine or grinder, looking at the $400-800+ minimums for each that redditors claim you have to spend, this $300 machine has me perfectly satisfied as someone who just likes 'good' coffee and doesn't need 'best in class' at home. The mental stress I didn't know I had about having to get the super expensive 'entry-level' gear is all gone and it feels wonderful.

If you have any questions about it, lemme know and I'll be happy to answer them.","Breville Bambino (non-Plus) PSA + Review (as a filthy casual) **PSA**: The thing comes with a milk pitcher and non-pressurized basket now.

Aeropress vs Pressurised Portafilter,"Hi all,

I am enjoying what I am getting from this, especially now that I've found a local coffee roasters.

As it would take up a chunk of my kitchen surface, I was interested to know if I should expect any noticeable improvement in using this over my aeropress? Or is this a matter of opinion?

My coffee grinder will not produce fine enough for bottomless, nor do I have the funds to upgrade anything currently, so it's either stick with what I have, or take the machine.

Antique coffee grinder restauration,"Hello fellow coffee lovers!

(Tldr : do you know a way to remove rust on burrs without making them less sharp or bringing bad taste to the coffee grinded? And do you have any ideas about oils I could use to varnish the wood that doesn't go rancid or have a taste? Linseed oil seems applicable because it doesn't go rancid but is bitter so idk what to use.)


I recently acquired an antique Peugeot coffee grinder at a flea market. It is in quite good condition for the price (20€) so I wanted to try to restore it. 

There is rust on the handle that I removed by sanding but I don't know how to properly clean the burrs. As there is some rust around the burrs but not on the parts that actually grind the beans, I was tempted to soak it in vinegar and salt (to remove rust according to some web articles). However I also read that putting any liquid on the burrs would decrease their efficiency and was generally bad. Any suggestions? 

My other issue is dealing with the wood. It's quite old but in good condition, though coffee has been sitting there for a long time. That's why I wanted to try to sand it a bit with fine grit and then varnish it with something. The issue is that either the products are not food safe, either it can be done using oils that get rancid over time or that bring a bad taste. I thought of using linseed oil but it seems to be bitter at taste so idk if this will have any consequences on the end cup. 

It's my first time posting there so I hope I'm doing things the right way ^^

Cleaning Flat burr grinders,"Hi,

How much mains pressure does a barista machine require? Possible off grid?,"I've recently opened a micro farm on the south coast of England and since opening many of my customers have asked me if there is anywhere nearby to buy good coffee.

Brewing Ratios - immersion vs. Percolation,"I am struggling to understand why I should use a higher ratio for immersion brewing compared to percolation methods (e.g. 70g/l vs 60g/l).

After reading up some the best explanation i could come up with is the fact that the interstitial liquid left in the grounds at the end of the brewing process has different strengths (because it was much less involved in the extraction process with a percolation method). Therefore the percolation brew in the cup would have a higher strength with the same ration compared to immersion.

Im not sure whether that explains the recommendation. Is there another reason i didn't think of?","Brewing Ratios - immersion vs. Percolation I am struggling to understand why I should use a higher ratio for immersion brewing compared to percolation methods (e.g. 70g/l vs 60g/l).

Boiling just water without coffee doesn't cause the pot to leak, so I thought I was choking the pot and then ground coarser. Much coarser (I'm at number 25 out of 31 on my Baratza Sette 270). But the leakage still happens.

Then I noticed that there is a small dent on my rim of lower part of the pot. (See photos). Does this look like a damaged pot?

I'm probably returning this unit and buying a new one, but I wanted to know what the more trained eyes have to say about it.

iced coffe with a french press?,"I am a somewhat infrequent coffee drinker, and when I do make coffee it is in a cute little 300mL french press. As the temps warm up, I was wondering how I might use that french press for iced coffee. To those of you who might ask, ""what about cold brew?"" that takes too long. When I want coffee, it's a spur of the moment thing, so I need something that I can make hot, then chill to the proper temp. Does anyone have a recipe like that? I need grind size, bean to water ratio (in grams in case that wasn't obvious), brew time, and how much ice to use. If it matters, I tend to drink floral light roasts with low acidity.","iced coffe with a french press?

Experiences with the moka pot,"Usually put in cold water, put it on a medium hob (3/6) and it usually comes out the spout in 10 mins. Flavour is like rich and nutty to the point where everyone in the office smells it and leaves positive comments when I take it in a flask to work.

Recently for some reason it has taken a minute or two longer to come out of the spout, which makes it taste a little more bitter/sour than I’d like but still OK. 

Remember hearing you’re supposed to use boiling water to avoid that, but in the past that caused the coffee to taste completely sour so I just stuck to cold water usually. Today I tried mostly cold water but with a dash of boiling water and it came out in 9 mins instead. Let me tell you, the coffee this time around has got to be the cleanest, lightest cup I’ve ever brewed in my life. It doesn’t even have that strong nutty smell anymore, it’s more subtle, and it has a kind of smoothness similar to tea. 

Honestly don’t know what I like more lol the 10 minute one is almost rich like chocolate, the 9 minute one is kinda refreshing.

Here's how you can get water at the temperature you want without having a variable temperature kettle.,"You can boil a small amount of water and mix it with water at room temperature.
Using the right proportions, you get water at whatever temperature you want.

To get the right proportions between the boiling and room temperature water, use this table (see the example below for how to use the table).

|room temperature/final temperature|65|70|75|80|85|90|95|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|8|0.62|0.67|0.73|0.78|0.84|0.89|0.95|

|24|0.54|0.61|0.67|0.74|0.8|0.87|0.93|

# Example 1:
So if my room temperature is 12 degrees and I want to get water at 70 degrees, I'll use a factor of 0.66. That means to get 1L of water at 70 degrees, I'll boil 0.66L of water and mix it with 0.34L of water at room temperature.

# Example 2:
If I need 500g of water at 85 degrees and my room temperature is 22 degrees, I'll need 0.81*500g ~ 400g of boiling water and 100g of water at room temperature.

If you'd like an exact formula, it is the following:

```
mass_of_boiling_water = (final_temperature - room_temperature)/(100 - room temperature) x total_mass
```

Gaggia Classic (2003) found in garage. Help appreciated.,"So, my uncle was clearing out his garage and found an unwanted Gaggia Classic (2003 model) that's been in there for about 10 years, it's pretty dusty and dirty including the dried coffee from the last use.

I instantly knew what it was because of the James Hoffmann video making the best £250 espresso setup.

So I found myself now with lovely machine in a sorry state, with dreams in my head of finally making some good at home espresso. The thing is I don't know where to begin with it, full tear down? Good scrub and descale? The water tank and silicone tubes are good? 

Sorry for the lack of photos, it seems in good condition but I don't know how to tell. It does switch on. 

I might be over thinking this whole thing but I like the idea of refurbing this thing and then I can tweak it from there.

tl;dr I have a 2003 model Gaggia Classic that's been in the garage for 10 years and want to know the level of cleaning and where to start.

Help - having trouble pulling a decent shot of espresso (new espresso machine),"I just bought a new Rancilio Silvia (new to me, not the Pro).

I am having trouble dialing in my shot. I know I need to buy a grinder. I have a hand-me-down Cuisinart burr grinder but the finest grind is too coarse for my machine.

I bought some Lavazza espresso grind -- too coarse. Pissed out about 1 cup of coffee in &lt;20 sec.

Next, I bought some Illy espresso grind. I'm able to get closer but the yield is still between 50ml - 100ml for 15g in the double basket (brewing at 195 - 202 degrees).

So, I went to the local roaster who gave me 4 different grinds to try (for free, thank you, kind roaster). 3 were non-starters: way too coarse or way too fine. One option pulled ~40ml for 15g in the double basket. It tasted OK, not perfect. This is still too fine, right? Too much yield. I tamped the crap out of it.

I'm a bit type A, so I have a spreadsheet tracking the input, pre-infusion time, brew time, yield, result. I have not pulled one great shot yet. For comparison, I can pull a perfectly fine shot on my friend's commercial-grade machine grinding the beans fresh in his billion dollar professional-grade grinder.

*Sigh*

The only way out of this is to buy a decent burr grinder, right? The machine is tricked out with PID, so I can dial in the temperature exactly. I don't think that's the problem.","Help - having trouble pulling a decent shot of espresso (new espresso machine) I just bought a new Rancilio Silvia (new to me, not the Pro).

"Need a ""for dummies"" version for choosing a machine"," I posted this exact same thing in r/nespresso and got suggestions to come here since I'm not stuck on the machine being a Nespresso

Here's my deal. I know nothing about specialty coffee except that I do love espresso and mainly want to make my own mochas without going out to coffee shops. It's just me at home so I don't need anything really fancy. I am looking at the Nespresso machines because I'm hearing that they create the best flavor. I have a budget of about $140 for a machine &amp; an additional $30-40 for a protection plan. My questions about choosing a machine:

1. Is my budget too low? I am looking at going through Amazon (which I know some people hate) because I have Prime and always get good customer service with them in case of problems.
2. What is the ""original"" machine(s)? I was told the pods are the best and cheapest. I don't know if I can make mochas with this one though. I'd like to make mochas most of all.
3. Is Nespresso the best choice for me? I'd like the convenience of pods but being able to also use my own coffee would be more budget-friendly.
4. I have looked at other machines but don't know if they are worth it. What about machines like the Chef Wave and other espresso makers?
5. Are there universal/reusable pods for the Nespresso or the other ""good"" machines?
6. I'm looking at making 1 mocha a day (occasionally 2). I expect to spend about $35 for coffee pods (if I can't use my own grounds).
7. I have a milk frother already.

So, basically, I want a machine that makes good coffee without it being a complicated process. I want something very simple to use and not too hard on the wallet for buying the coffee.

Talk to me like I'm not the brightest 5 year old. This appliance is going to cost a lot (for me) but coffee is my one real pleasure these days.","Need a ""for dummies"" version for choosing a machine  I posted this exact same thing in r/nespresso and got suggestions to come here since I'm not stuck on the machine being a Nespresso

My Coffee Addiction/Withdrawal Journey,"I worked as a backup to our lead at a licensed Starbucks store for 12 years, with a 13th as just a barista.   During this time, which began when I was 27, I started with mochas...I enjoyed the dark chocolate flavor and how it mixed with the bitter espresso.   Like many of us, I eventually graduated to Americanos (they're cheaper), then black coffee, then straight espresso shots.   The work environment was extremely stressful, fast-paced, and busy, and we usually earned about $15k-$18k/wk at our peak with a skeleton crew of never more than 6 baristas, total, on the schedule (including the lead).   If we had to work 6 days a week to keep it open, that was just tough. 

During this time, I realized as I got older, I couldn't keep up with the pace.   So I did what we all do, got my Xanax prescription increased, and started pounding more and more shots so I could keep up.   My boss was not understanding of anything less than excellence, and I was convinced she deserved it.   It was unacceptable and *weak* to not be 100% ""on"" in the workplace.   My doctor started to advise me that my anxiety, heart rate, and bowel movements were all being negatively impacted, but I brushed it off.   This was *caffeine"" we're talking about...its not a serious drug.

About 5 years in, I developed interstitial cystitis.   It took me 2 years to get a diagnosis.    Caffeine is a horrible trigger for this condition, but I gave up orange juice and other trigger foods and decided I'd double down on coffee.   I can't do my job if I don't drink coffee after all.    And it was *unprofessional* not to be a coffee drinker and work at Starbucks.   

After about 8 or 9 years, my anxiety began to seriously increase in intensity.   Angry outbursts happened with customers, co-workers, anyone who I could lash out at, because my resting heart rate was now well above 100.   But I'd done this so long, I don't know how to do any other job.   Starbucks is the way.   So I just decided ""no cold brew,"" and kept on.

11 years in, I was hospitalized.   The ER doctor said I had ""caffeine intoxication.""   ""A toxic amount of caffeine is in your blood.    Have you been consuming more than 250mg a day?""   I laughed.   ""It's *easily* upwards of 500.""   He grimaced, but I laughed it off.   I'd just taper it down, do half-caff.   I wasn't addicted I could quit whenever I want.   Meanwhile, I developed nasty case of IBS.

At year 12, I had a mental breakdown.   Starbucks consumed my every waking thought, and I knew if I left leadership there it would soon fall apart.   But I finally got the courage to tell my boss I couldn't handle the pressure anymore.   It was my anxiety, you see.  My coffee intake continued.    A year later, I asked for a transfer out of Starbucks.   Now, I'll quit, I said.

I didn't for at least 2 years.   I developed nasty acid reflux, which I'm medicated for morning and night.

It's now 5 days ago.   I didn't have a bowel movement for over 48 hours.     The doctor said ""you have done significant damage over time to your bowel system with your coffee intake, and if you don't quit caffeine, it won't get better.""   He prescribed me several fine products that I'm now using, and I made the decision there:   the only way for me to break the addiction to coffee...was to go cold turkey.   Tapering off always resulted in me falling off the wagon again.   (Continued)","My Coffee Addiction/Withdrawal Journey I worked as a backup to our lead at a licensed Starbucks store for 12 years, with a 13th as just a barista.   During this time, which began when I was 27, I started with mochas...I enjoyed the dark chocolate flavor and how it mixed with the bitter espresso.   Like many of us, I eventually graduated to Americanos (they're cheaper), then black coffee, then straight espresso shots.   The work environment was extremely stressful, fast-paced, and busy, and we usually earned about $15k-$18k/wk at our peak with a skeleton crew of never more than 6 baristas, total, on the schedule (including the lead).   If we had to work 6 days a week to keep it open, that was just tough. 

During this time, I realized as I got older, I couldn't keep up with the pace.   So I did what we all do, got my Xanax prescription increased, and started pounding more and more shots so I could keep up.   My boss was not understanding of anything less than excellence, and I was convinced she deserved it.   It was unacceptable and *weak* to not be 100% ""on"" in the workplace.   My doctor started to advise me that my anxiety, heart rate, and bowel movements were all being negatively impacted, but I brushed it off.   This was *caffeine"" we're talking about...its not a serious drug.

About 5 years in, I developed interstitial cystitis.   It took me 2 years to get a diagnosis.    Caffeine is a horrible trigger for this condition, but I gave up orange juice and other trigger foods and decided I'd double down on coffee.   I can't do my job if I don't drink coffee after all.    And it was *unprofessional* not to be a coffee drinker and work at Starbucks.   

After about 8 or 9 years, my anxiety began to seriously increase in intensity.   Angry outbursts happened with customers, co-workers, anyone who I could lash out at, because my resting heart rate was now well above 100.   But I'd done this so long, I don't know how to do any other job.   Starbucks is the way.   So I just decided ""no cold brew,"" and kept on.

11 years in, I was hospitalized.   The ER doctor said I had ""caffeine intoxication.""   ""A toxic amount of caffeine is in your blood.    Have you been consuming more than 250mg a day?""   I laughed.   ""It's *easily* upwards of 500.""   He grimaced, but I laughed it off.   I'd just taper it down, do half-caff.   I wasn't addicted I could quit whenever I want.   Meanwhile, I developed nasty case of IBS.

At year 12, I had a mental breakdown.   Starbucks consumed my every waking thought, and I knew if I left leadership there it would soon fall apart.   But I finally got the courage to tell my boss I couldn't handle the pressure anymore.   It was my anxiety, you see.  My coffee intake continued.    A year later, I asked for a transfer out of Starbucks.   Now, I'll quit, I said.

I didn't for at least 2 years.   I developed nasty acid reflux, which I'm medicated for morning and night.

It's now 5 days ago.   I didn't have a bowel movement for over 48 hours.     The doctor said ""you have done significant damage over time to your bowel system with your coffee intake, and if you don't quit caffeine, it won't get better.""

DF64 declumper mods,"I have been really unhappy with the declumper on the DF64. I drink mostly V60s at home and occasionally will make espresso, but the declumper on my DF64 would result in a lot more fines and ruined the clarity I love in my pour over coffee.

With that being said,  today, I removed the declumper in its entirety and tbh it has had a dramatically positive effect on the grind quality. Yes, static is worse and I need to manually declump for espresso but those are easily resolved with slightly more effort on my side.

First I used whatever crap beans from Lidl I happened to have in the cupboard and no matter how I adjusted it the end result was just very sour and borderline undrinkable. Raising temperature and setting a finer grind helped but not enough. I was hoping I'll get better results with some better beans and I got a new bag of quality beans and I couldn't tell absolutely no difference, still very sour borderline undrinkable coffee. Went through the whole bag of beans just trying different settings and nothing really helped.

Then got another bag of espresso beans which were marked as having low acidity and then I followed Hoffmann's guide where he suggests setting grind to around the midrange/stock and just leaving it there, then measure dry grind weight (which was about 13.7 g on this machine with ""extra-strong taste"" setting) and then adjust extracted coffee to around 1:4 ratio and try increasing amount of coffee. I tried 55-&gt;85 g range of extracted coffee but don't really notice a big difference. Maybe the taste gets a tiny bit blander and very tiny bit more bitter? These beans were clearly a big difference though, now the end result is definitely way less acidic and at least drinkable. I am still quite disappointed though...

Can the Dolce-Gusto machines make a espresso/espresso-like drink?,"I've recently purchased a Dolce Gusto Genio S. And after looking online for some pods, I found out that you can input your own coffee grounds using reusable pods.

I found this quite interesting because a downside that I have heard about pod machines is that you get less customisability and lower quality, based off of the fact that the coffee in the pods is pre-ground, and often times subpar.

The Genio S has a maximum of 15 bars of pressure, which apparently is enough to make espresso.

Esam 4200 settings help - Espresso?... (delonghi bean to cup),"So I have had an ESAM 4200 for a while now, been using it to just make mugs of coffee (max liquid, max dose, ""double"" shot) and been content with it, but I wish to up my game, using the same machine.

I have attached an image of current grind size (I know it is near impossible to convey this through an image but it is better than nothing) and this is on grind setting 4 (on a 1 to 7 scale).

I have watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6yWOyNq0uw&amp;t=132s) on setting these kinds of machine up, and he (james hoffmann) recommends, and I'm paraphrasing, not trying to chase true espresso. going for courser grind settings etc etc. This machine has a 15bar pump (strong enough for espresso) and I wondered if anyone has any advice on whether or not I could go finer, I wish to go as fine as I can to get as close as possible to espresso.

Does anybody have experience with this machine, or advice on how far I can push this before I am likely to experience channeling and such. Lastly, does anybody have any experience or recommendations in using this by single dosing the beans, instead of hopper feeding?

Thanks in advance!

"Rocket vs ECM, HX vs Dual Boiler - Which one to choose?","Hey there coffee enthusiasts! I’ve been using the Gaggia Classic Pro for some time and I am now ready to invest in a more professional espresso machine for my new appartment. Ideally, I would like to keep this new machine for many years and in some near future also plumb it directly to a water source. This is why I’m looking at purchasing an espresso machine with a rotary pump. The design of this machine is very important to me as I want it to be the piece of resistance of my apartment. After conducting my research, I’ve narrowed down my options to 4 machines, two Rocket and two ECM models (one HX and one dual boiler per brand), which all seem to perform great. Unfortunately, I’m still hesitating between the models below and I can find a proper recommendation online. I’m not sure if I should invest the extra money and get a dual boiler machine or if one brand is generally better than the other.

These are the models I’m currently looking at:
- Rocket Mozzafiato Evo R (~1,840 USD)
- Rocket Cinquantotto (~2,333 USD)
- ECM Technika V PID (~2,287 USD)
- ECM Synchronika (~2,687 USD)

I prefer to stick the same coffee beans and will probably not experiment as much as others with frequently changing beans. I drink about two coffees a day, usually a latte in the morning and an espresso after lunch. I also like to invite my family and neighbors to a cup of coffee every now and then. So I don’t expect to make more than 4 coffee drinks per day.

Which model would you choose? Would you go against one of these and if so why? Dual boiler or HX for a home setup? Rocket or ECM?

Thanks a ton!

Breville Precision Brewer Overflowing When Using Cone Filter,"Hello, 

A couple of days ago I purchased the Breville Precision Brewer with thermal Carafe. Every time I use the cone filter, the cone overflows. I have tried using less coffee, courser grind coffee, different brewing modes, different amounts of water,calling  Breville to troubleshoot (not helpful at all). 

Does anyone else who owns the precision Brewer have an idea of what might be happening?

Thanks","Breville Precision Brewer Overflowing When Using Cone Filter Hello,

Super-automatic machines - Philips and Siemens - how is the cleaning and maintenance like with the higher-end models,"This will be a quick one and I hereby swear I will (hopefully) get an answer and I won't taint your delicious subreddit full of things which actually matter (beans and machines for real men).

Anyway, we have some local sweet sales on Philips and Siemens super-automatic machines. I am looking at those usually costing $600-900. I currently have a lower-end 2200-series machine (non-LatteGo) and I like it, for my very simple taste it makes a good coffee, but cleaning and maintaining it is one hell of an experience. I am also looking at them to get some more fancy milky stuff out of it. Anyway, here's what the cleaning of my current one includes:

\- cleaning the nozzle of frother is fine, it takes me just a couple of seconds  
\- the tray for the ground coffee waste is more annoying, but because it is not just about throwing it out, but about a mold already forming in it, so each time it requires a full clean with a dish soap etc.\`; draining the water tray is fine, at least there isn't any mold there  
\- whether a weekly or monthly interior cleaning (including the brewing unit) is a nightmare, I open the compartment door and there is coffee and mold everywhere - my favorite part are all the crevices with a stuck moldy coffee - cleaning this is about 30-60 minutes ceremony and four stages of cleaning (wet wipe, dish soap clean, dry wipe, rubbing alcohol cleaning of the stubborn stuck coffee/mold).

Has anyone have any experience with more expensive Philips/Saeco or Siemens models? Do they have a better internal design (e.g. a better isolated layout) so that one doesn't feel like they would rather drink moldy coffee than having to go through that cleaning nightmare?","Super-automatic machines - Philips and Siemens - how is the cleaning and maintenance like with the higher-end models This will be a quick one and I hereby swear I will (hopefully) get an answer and I won't taint your delicious subreddit full of things which actually matter (beans and machines for real men).

"[Gear] Caffe Italy / Coffee Italy, is a very shady store, and people should proceed with caution.","Greetings,

I recently started doing my research on getting my first espresso machine, but where I live, its kinda hard to find good prices for espresso machines. One or max 2 stores offer it, so it makes doing ""smart"" decisions lot harder. But then I stumbled upon this store ""Caffe Italia"". And they seemed to have great deal on the same machine I was looking to get, Gaggia Classic Pro. 

Quick browse around the internet, lead me to believe they might ship a machine atleast, if I paid with my credit card, the risk would be relatively low. I would just let my credit card company handle the plausible issues, and I would mod the gaggia anyways, so bad warranty was kinda expected. But while doing the order, I mistyped my card info, which resulted in order failing (transaction didn't go through) but order still processed? Idk what happened, its kinda buggy. But I left the customer support a message, on what happened.

It took them few days to respond, but they still did. In their email they just stated that ""just order it again"", and thats about it. The thing is, they responded 5 hours after their ""opening hours"", yeah, its probably out sourced, as everything is. But kinda shady in my opinion. Hard to imagine their support staff is working 10pm on a friday night, support hours listed on site is 10-16. Language was also pretty bad, probably worse than google translated, so probably 2 rounds of google translate? 

Then I went around and started looking around trust pilots. I don't know how I missed it on my initial sweep, but atleast entire finnish trustpilot site is botted, with obvious grammar mistakes on every review. Also almost like they are arguing the bad ones. 

Entire reason I'm typing this out now, is so people can find a post stating that this site is pretty shady. Everything on the internet seems to be just spammed with positive stuff, to hide the bad and honest stuff.

Search term ""Caffe Italia Reddit"", etc obvious experience thread tags are covered in non related posts. Can't prove they are trying to hide it, but wouldn't be out of ordinary for them it seems like... They also list their HQ to be in Finland/what ever portal of their site you look at. All just trying to make it seem more legit.

Also, if I'm wrong about them, on my initial impressions, you are free to prove me wrong. Share your expriences here, and I'll gladly delete this post. 

TLDR: This store is doing some very shady stuff, with obvious review botting. Even if they deliver on their products, I can't imagine plausible warranty support even existing.","[Gear] Caffe Italy / Coffee Italy, is a very shady store, and people should proceed with caution. Greetings,

I also want to avoid anything with a lot of plastic that gets heated up. Glass + metal is fine but with microplastics becoming more of a concern I'd like to have something that not only is easy, gives a great taste, but also is less likely to be toxic.

Money isn't a huge concern though I doubt he's going to want to spend several hundreds / thousands on anything.","Coffeemaker recommendations?

Clever dripper question,"Hello! I’ve been dabbling with a clever dripper for a bit and I’m not completely sure about how the crust effects extraction.

From the beans, should I let the crust stay longer? Or break the crust sooner and let the coffee settle at the bottom? Does more coffee extract from the crust, or from settled coffee?

Induction-compatible stainless gooseneck kettle that can actually hold 800ml of boiling water?,"I make french press coffee for two every morning and espresso or pourover once or twice a week, and I'm using a big ~20 year old Copco kettle that is kind of a mess inside and out, and pouring from its big spout isn't super accurate. I just got a Hario Buono 1L kettle and was surprised to learn when I got it home that you can't actually boil 1L (or even 750ml, which is what I use for french press) of water in it: to reach the advertised 1L capacity, you have to fill the kettle up to the tippy-top, meaning that you can't even put the lid on without water overflowing the kettle. I tried to boil just 750ml of water in it and the lid popped off and the kettle boiled over before it even got to a rolling boil. So the 1L capacity, while technically accurate, is kind of useless when the kettle is actually used for its express purpose of boiling water.

Hario makes a 1.2L version but based on my experience with the 1L version, I'm not confident that the extra 20% capacity will prevent boil-over, and most other manufacturers of nice stainless kettles make versions right around 1L capacity.

Buying a starter espresso machine,"Hello,

Ravenous hunger after drinking espresso,"Hi guys, so I used to drink espressos (one in the morning right after waking up and another after lunch) for years and besides giving me energy it would actually suppress my appetite, making me less hungry most times. Now I'm back into drinking the exact same amount of espressos a day and although the energy effect is the exact same as yeats ago, its making me extremely hungry after each shot, and it seems like no amount of food I eat is every enough to make my stomach stop growling... its annoying and idk why this is happening. Not drinking coffee is completely out of question and lowering the caffeine dosage aswell, since I feel like the psychological effects of two shots of espresso a day are my ideal state and I haven't felt mentally this well in a long time.

Quickly Graphing Coffee Balance,"I've been thinking about coffee logging recently, and wanted to come up with a way to quickly note down the basic balance of a cup without having to use much descriptive language. Here's what I've come up with. 

Imagine a graph with X and Y axis, and in the middle is the theoretical perfect cup. (Not objective, but according to your taste.) One axis would represent strength, and the other, extraction. A coffee that tasted strong, but too acidic or salty might be a high strength, low extraction brew. One that tasted weak and a little subdued or flat would be low strength, high extraction. All you would have to do is draw your graph axis and make a mark for how you thought the coffee tasted. The closer to your ideal balance, the better. 

It was inspired partly by some recent Ārāmse videos about coffee logging and their coffee recipe builder system, and also by a plugin I use in my recording software that uses two axis (axes?) to balance EQ. (I've linked a screencap.) 

What do you think? Would this be useful as part of your coffee log?

Frothed milk tweaks with evaporated milk for moka pot espresso style drinks,"I love coffee, and I love the nerdy alchemy of it all. Drinking it is only the second best  part of the experience, and the crazy equipment/technique black hole keeps pulling me in. However, while I'd love to own a big-boy espresso machine and go nuts every morning making cortados and flat whites for my family while shouting about grind size and extraction rates at my neighbours, I am currently relying on a moka pot to get me as close to a tasty espresso type drink at home as I can without dropping major $$$.   

I've followed Hoffman's moka technique and I can get a consistently delicious strong brew, but without a proper steam wand, I am largely limited to an Aerolatte hand frother, which is actually pretty good at getting a decent microfoam in heated full-fat milk. Not perfect, since it requires a few iterations of froth/shake down stir/froth some more so that the few larger bubbles pop and the milk gets a bit more uniform, but the final result is totally acceptable.

One thing I've experimented with (and I was wondering if anyone has thoughts on) is adding evaporated milk in a 1:3 ratio to full fat milk before heating and frothing in order to get some more velvety thickness in the milk foam, along with a sweeter and richer taste. I'm guessing that the evaporation and heating process involved with evaporated milk does something chemically to the milk proteins that is similar to the effect steam has on the flavour of regular milk, but I honestly don't know what, other than that it's a definite improvement over just plain milk.   

Would appreciate any nerdy ideas about what might be happening here, and if there's any other tweaks that you guys would recommend :)","Frothed milk tweaks with evaporated milk for moka pot espresso style drinks I love coffee, and I love the nerdy alchemy of it all.

I've just moved to the US and I'm struggling to find the right coffee beans,"I've recently moved from the UK to the US and I'm a little overwhelmed with the choices for coffee beans.

I've been drinking the [""Jailbreak: Red Blend"" from Hasbean](https://www.hasbean.co.uk/products/jailbreak) for years which has notes of dark chocolate, hazelnut and toffee. It's my favorite coffee blend but obviously it's not available in the US.

If anyone is kind enough to recommend a roaster or blend with similar notes? I would really appreciate that.

I have been going through threads on here and have tried the Southern Weather, Geometry, Monarch and Geometry Blends from [Onyx](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/collections/coffee).

Does resting coffee matter for immersion methods?,"So from what I understand, freshly roasted coffee has more aromatics than rested coffee, but the coffee nevertheless still needs to rest because the carbon dioxide byproduct of roasting interferes with extraction. While I can see how this would be an issue for drip style coffee, espresso, and pour overs given the limited contact time with water, is it also a problem for immersion style extraction methods such as Turkish coffee or French press? As far as I can see, the carbon dioxide may interfere with extraction initially, but then the length with which water is in contact with the coffee would overcome any initial difficulties in extraction, in which case you should brew with the coffee immediately to maximize aromatics.","Does resting coffee matter for immersion methods?

[Question][Gear] What's the best hand grinder for filter coffee that I can get for about $200 NZD? (That's roughly $115 USD/€108/£90.),"So $200 NZD may sound like more than it actually is, since our dollar isn't that strong, sales tax (and import fees) are typically included, and things are typically more expensive (or just plain unavailable) here.

For reference, I'm looking for things around the price of:

* $115 USD
* $145 CAD
* €108 EURO (before VAT)
* £90 (before tax)

I'm leaning towards the [Timemore Chestnut C2](https://www.amazon.com.au/TIMEMORE-chestnut-electricity-Portable-positioning/dp/B0833SDN8M/) which can be found for roughly $100 NZD, which seems much less expensive than other grinders of similar quality. This looks like the best deal around; even the [Porlex Mini II](https://www.amazon.com.au/Porlex-Mini-II-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B082L26FLX) costs more. A simple upgrade to the [Timemore Chestnut G1](https://www.amazon.com.au/TIMEMORE-Chestnut-Stainless-Adjustable-Positioning/dp/B08TX43SSF/) triples the price to $300 NZD, so I won't bother with that.

Looking at other brands, the [1Zpresso Q2](https://www.amazon.com.au/1Zpresso-AeroPress-Stainless-Numerical-Adjustable/dp/B083TGGHGL/) seems to cost at least $230 NZD; more than twice as much as the C2. The Comandante C40 comes in at $500 or [$400 on sale](https://www.espressoninja.co.nz/product/comandante-c40-mk3-hand-grinder-black/), which is sadly way out of my budget. 

Looking at some other brands: the [Hero manual grinder](https://www.amazon.com.au/Manual-Coffee-Grinder-Stainless-Conical/dp/B08X39ZJMB/) comes in at a reasonable $120 NZD and the [Normcore](https://www.amazon.com.au/Manual-Coffee-Grinder-Adjustable-Stainless/dp/B089P1MNW5/) comes in at $145.

Peugeot (the French car company) makes [a beautiful one](https://www.thecoffeecompany.co.nz/product/peugeot-kronos-coffee-grinder) for $200.

And that's basically everything I've been able to find. Any suggestions of models I've missed? What do you think my best option is? I can afford to go over the price of the Timemore Chestnut C2 but given the competition I don't know if there's a point.

Will 1-2 week old refrigerated coffee make me sick?,"For reference, it was a french press brew that I made somewhere around a week or two ago. Before putting it in the fridge I removed the grounds so it was just plain black coffee. No milk, sugar, nothing. It smells fine and tastes pretty much normal (not as strong as it once was, obviously). I've only tried a little, will continuing to drink it make me sick? I'm a frequent coffee drinker, at least once a day, sometimes more sometimes not at all, but definitely 5-6 times a week.  I don't usually get upset stomachs, or sick to any degree for that matter.

Need recommendations for a brand that has been out of stock for a while,"I have been regularly drinking Decaf Don Pablo light roast for 5 or so years now, and it’s my absolute favorite coffee.

Is my Grinder Burrs Ruined? Need Help - Eureka Mignon Perfetto,"I have Bought a used Eureka Mignon Perfetto and I planned on using it on a Delonghi Dedica EC685.

"I've learnt to now drink coffee black, and gawk at milk or sugar.","I've been a barista for close to about 8-years, working full-time during college and now freelance. Like many, I used to douse my coffee with milk and sugar. I drank the whole menu at Starbucks and couldn't imagine drinking something black. Instead, I needed it milky like the sun and would impress my barista friends at the number of pumps of sugar I used. I used to be the person that would put a quarter of drizzle in my Starbucks Caramel Macchiato. 

Now, being 28 years old, I don't drink coffee everyday, but when I do, I drink it black. It's taken me a long time to enjoy coffee this way, and I think anyone can learn to drink it black as well. It just takes small incremental changes, and a desire to change.

Where I started: I used to be the kid that put 10 pumps of classic, or sugar in my cup. Any drink, you name it. I needed a quarter-cup of cream, and at least 3-4 packets of sugar, Splenda, Equal etc. I couldn't imagine why anyone would want hot bean water. I saw coffee as a drink to energize. At the time, I was working at Starbucks, so I had the sugar and milk and cream to my disposal.

I eventually got a job in a third-wave coffee shop and anyone that knows coffee, now knows Starbucks is a terrible cup of coffee. It's good for a pinch and social status, for carrying that white-green mermaid cup, but if you want good coffee, you go to a third-wave coffeeshop and café. I'm talking about Irving Farm, Blue Bottle, Hungry Ghost, etc. 

Sugar is by far the easiest thing to let go. Just reduce your intake by a quarter. You'll hardly notice and especially if you're pairing your cup of coffee to a pastry or meal, you definitely won't miss it. 

Cream just does magical things to coffee. It makes it turn milky-white, and silky-smooth on your tongue. And that's exactly why you need to remove it. Around this time, I started to drink black tea black, without milk or sugar. I got stuck on the cream, no-sugar phase for a while. 

I recently started to take a sip of my coffee before I would drop in cream. Like an ode to coffee, or a tribute, I would taste the first sip black, before I added cream. Stuck on this phase for a while. 

Eventually, I just got lazy. I would still take that first sip. Sometimes I would add cream. Other times, I'd get too busy and forget I had the coffee, but I would chug it down. Happened too many times to me.

Then one day, I just started to drink it black. I didn't enjoy it, but I would make a face after every sip. Like drinking a shot of alcohol, I would purge and gawk. 

If you ever drink coffee black, you know it's most bitter at it's highest temperature. So one day, I started to experiment. I'd let it cool to warm or room-temperature. That did the trick.

Today, I'm cream-free, sugar-free and loving it. Coffee is a ritual and part of my day, but I enjoy it black. I didn't think I could ever get here, from 10-pumps of sugar, to cream no-sugar, to now, black.

This was 3-years in the making. I'm now free. 

That being said, time to make a cup.","I've learnt to now drink coffee black, and gawk at milk or sugar.

Is the Clever dripper (large) the logical next purchase? and where to buy?,"Hi

I have gotten back into coffee drinking, and also home roasting (right now Poppery with coffee from Sweet Maria's, though may get a Fresh Roast), and primarily use an old Zassenhaus to grind and use in an Aeropress with paper filter (use Hoffman's recipe). Also own a french press, and a couple of Bialettis (small and large size) that I almost never use. I drink about 1-2 cups max a day, average bit less than 1 as don't drink coffee every day. 

I just bought a Timemore C2 Max (may also get an 1zpresso) for a better (or at least faster grinder) and looking forward to using it. 

Thinking would be nice to try either the Clever or Hario Switch (Clever seems a bit cheaper and plastic for better heat retention) to change it up with the Aeropress.  Is Amazon the main place to buy the Clever (seems like walmart also has it but not sure its genuine, as sellers aren't walmart per se).? 

Any thoughts on if this is a good progression or other suggestions?

new to coffee. Need tips for work espresso machine,"Hiya, I'm new to coffee. I don't typically have a taste for bitter things, but I've only recently found myself access to what I assume is *good* coffee. So I need help making this work for me.

My work place has an espresso machine. This is where I get my coffee. You select an option on the screen, it grinds the coffee and pours it. Options for chocolate, and what I can only assume is coffee creamer.

I've been gaining weight and can't figure out why when my diet has been stable. I realized this selection I'm using must be coffee creamer (I didn't know what it was before a few weeks ago). And I've been basically drinking 1 4oz shot + 10oz coffee creamer once or twice a day for 4 days a week for months. Normally I take it easy on the sugar, like a lot. (I think that's why it hooked me so fast.)

What can I do to make a nice 14 to 16oz coffee? I can use stevia to sweeten, but once I take the creamer out of the equation, I only have the shots (and hot chocolate). Work has little non dairy creamer packs, but I'm trying to eliminate those calories. 

There's no coffee shops around, but I can bring in stuff to keep in the break room fridge.","new to coffee. Need tips for work espresso machine Hiya, I'm new to coffee.

"Was using a cheap electric grinder, bought a slightly more expensive hand grinder, and damnit, the coffee from the hand grinder is actually better...","I've honestly not been a huge coffee person for most of my life, I typically prefer tea.  

My wife and I have a nespresso vertuo at home, which was really more of something my wife was using, but toward the beginning of the pandemic, I started drinking more coffee from the nespresso (mostly because it was really easy to order the pods, while getting anything else at the time was more difficult.)

One of the things I like about tea is the absolutely massive number of tea choices you can explore, as well as a lot of the ritual that can be involved in brewing a nice cup of tea.  The nespresso doesn't really offer that, so I started looking further into what's out there for coffee.

I started out with a V60 and a Krups electric burr grinder.  My wife had bought a french press in the past, and I also ended up buying an aeropress.

With the french press and aeropress I've been able to make pretty decent coffee, and sometimes can make a good cup of coffee with the V60, but it kind of seems hit or miss, sometimes ending up a bit sour or bitter, or both.  

I also keep getting this ""paper"" flavor.  At first I thought it was coming from the paper filters I'm using, but then I realized I was tasting it when I wasn't using a filter as well.

I just bought a 1zpresso jx pro (I spent a bunch of time debating between the various timemore and 1zpresso grinders, and eventually decided to go with this one,) which, to be fair, is 3x the cost of the krups, but the grind is so much more consistent.  

I honestly wasn't expecting there to be that big of a difference in the flavor, but my pour overs have just been really nice using the new grinder.  No sourness, just ever so slightly on the edge of becoming bitter, which I'm assuming if I dialed up one more click would go away, none of the ""paper"" flavor I was getting with the Krups.  The flavor of the coffee seems more rounded (not sure how to better describe it.) And the coffee actually seems to have a bit more body as well, it's a really nice mouthfeel.

The water is also running through the coffee much slower, which I was worried about at first, thinking I was going to end up over-extracting the coffee, but it really wasn't.

The biggest problem I'm having with the new grinder is that it takes almost a minute of manually turning the crank to get enough grounds for the pour over, which I guess I'll get used to.","Was using a cheap electric grinder, bought a slightly more expensive hand grinder, and damnit, the coffee from the hand grinder is actually better...

How do you guys dial in your Clever Dripper brews?,"Hey :)
I've been really enjoying using the Clever Dripper recently due to its ease of use. I tend to get more interesting cups with my Aeropress or V60 though, so I think I need to work on my recipe/extraction.
I pretty much do what James Hoffmann recommends in his video. So: Water -&gt; Coffee -&gt; stir to wet all the grounds -&gt; 2mins -&gt; stir/shake to break the crust -&gt; 30sec -&gt; draw down.

To change the end result I can think of the following variables: ratio, water temperature, grind, steep time, agitation. 

I'm pretty happy with the strength of the coffee I get. I usually go for something like 65-70g per liter of water. 

As I use mostly light roasts I tend to brew with boiling water (or close to boiling, as there's some temperature loss due to starting with the water). With more medium roasts I drop it a couple of degrees. Steep time seems to only barely increase extraction in immersion or steep and release brews.
So what's left is grind and agitation. From what I can vaguely remember, with immersion brews, agitation has more significant of an effect than a finer/coarser grind. Because there's a percolation phase though, I would assume that the grind is more significant than in a French Press for example.

Of course I'm constantly trying out stuff myself, but I'd be interested to know what your experiences have been and how you've successfully adjusted the extraction with the Clever.","How do you guys dial in your Clever Dripper brews? Hey :)

I require a special device...,"So I need something that will hold the pressure in a percolator/stove top/bialetti from coming through, until it reaches a set pressure, then let flow through, the block the flow. 

This would sit on top of the inner spout, and block the flow using some kind of pressure regulator. As the pressure builds, no coffee could come through. When the pressure gets high enough, the valve opens and the coffee flows through and out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pressure then drops, after a while the valve should now shut.

Cappuccino vs Latte,"I work in a small local coffee shop and was taught that cappuccinos and lattes get the same amount of foam just that cappuccinos are traditionally 8oz. Nothing more or less. Lattes are 12oz and 16oz. So it’s just the matter of the amount of espresso and milk (all sizes get 2 shots and the rest with milk.)

An additional add on is a cortado is specifically 6oz but what’s your intake on the foam and how different is it to a cappuccino and latte?

how can I enjoy coffee as a caffeine sensitive Person?,"So i really love coffee. From the taste to the making of coffee and even the heritage. But i am really caffeine sensitive. When i have a cup of coffee, i just feel shaky, anxious, and my heart feels like it wants to jump out of my ribcage. 

Just about recently, i had two big cups of coca cola and then wanted to go for a walk. For some amount of time it was bearable, but when it started to get quite warm in the sun, all of a sudden, my pulse started going way up to the point where i even got dizzy so i had to sit down for a while, until i had calmed down a bit. 

I feel like it wasn't always like this, though. This changed when i once had chewing tobacco in high school and felt extremely sick afterwards from the nicotine. 

After this event, i now feel like i perceive the caffeine a lot stronger. I always felt it being strong, but i was able to drink a cup of coffee and not feel this bad. Although maybe I feel like the caffeine is stronger now because in my opinion, the effect that nicotine had on me was quite similar to caffeine to me. So maybe, because i associate this effect with feeling bad, it causes me to freak out slightly. 

Anyways, how can i continue to enjoy coffee as someone who is caffeine sensitive? I don't think that getting used to caffeine is a good option as i tried this not too long ago by drinking coffee once every day for a month and had only gotten used to the effect slightly.","how can I enjoy coffee as a caffeine sensitive Person?

Moka pot consistency,"I decided to measure the timing of my moka pot recipe, before I was only measuring yield. I use both a 3 cup and a 6 cup, both are the original Bialetti Moka Express. Same grind size, 14-15g and 28-30g respectively depending on the coffee since it needs to fill the funnel. I boil water in the bottom container, once it's boiling I add the funnel with coffee, screw in the top and restart the stove.

The time it takes to brew both is the same between 3 and 6 cup: 50s to get the first drops of coffee, 2min total for the entire brew, I remove as soon as it starts sputtering). Yields are the same, about 100g/200g of coffee (+/- 5g)

I was surprised how consistent it is, measured between multiple brews. I use a gas stove, always the same (smallest) burner and I use different settings for the 3 and 6 cup (which I can replicate using the numbers of the knob). Never achieved this kind of consistency when I had an electric stove.

So for me the conclusion is that it can be fairly consistent  (most of my measurements have some fluctuation, but it's negligible in terms of taste) but to get there it took a lot of practice using the same tools","Moka pot consistency I decided to measure the timing of my moka pot recipe, before I was only measuring yield.

Taste difference between a mug and an insulated flask,"Hello! 

Has anyone experienced a significant difference in taste drinking coffee from a mug and from an insulated flask? Any idea why this could be happening? 

When I prepare my coffee and drink at home, it tastes great but when I put the same coffee in a flask and bring it with me to the office, it tastes very bland and sour. I wouldn't believe they are the same coffee if I hadn't prepared it myself. 

This stopped me from taking coffee to work and have it with my breakfast at home instead which is not ideal as I like to enjoy it later in the day. 

The coffee we're talking about is double espresso and water from fresh ground beans.

Thanks :)","Taste difference between a mug and an insulated flask Hello!

"After 4 months pulling espressos almost daily, I finally tasted some notes and I'm mind blown","This happened around 15min ago and I'm still processing this.

After a few weeks of owning the EC680 I got a bit frustrated with it, and gave up on measuring anything related to espresso. I have vials with 18g of coffee and that's about it. I've been grinding with different settings, tamping with difference forces in an attempt to finally hit that ""spot"".

Today was that day, 18g in, distributed, tamped, added paper filters above and below the coffee bed, inserted into my machine, pressed go and realized that I was a bit too thin, it took a WHILE to get everything out (should be programmed to pull 50g of liquid).

Since I was getting some sour espressos before (since I upped my dose from 16g to 18g) I was okay with it since it looked pretty uniform. After 35~50 seconds it finished, I decided to taste it, since the smell was clean, I didn't feel that ""sour"" smell.

I swirled with a tiny spool I have and tasted all the crema that remained at the spool and HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT. it tasted fucking amazing, almost no bitterness, nice finish, and a super strong caramel/nuts flavor.

Second spoon was almost the same thing, and after that it all went downhill, turning bitter and bitter by the second.

I have no idea if it's possible to get the entire shot to taste like that, but that is something I really wanna try now. Glad I bought a new scale a few days ago, now I just have to wait and try everything again.

I need every single tip I can get to replicate this, I need another espresso like that in my life.","After 4 months pulling espressos almost daily, I finally tasted some notes and I'm mind blown This happened around 15min ago and I'm still processing this.

What to do about flavored coffee?,"My wife loves ground, hazelnut flavored coffee, and I will often make it for her using my own technique on a simple drip machine (see below). I recently tried to use my V60 and Aeropress to make her a cup but what I thought was going to be the outcome was not like I imagined. I remember going from drip to pour over with “unflavored” coffee and remember being able to taste flavor profiles I didn’t know existed. But with the flavored coffee all I got was a very clean cup of flavored coffee. No bitterness, no muddiness, no astringency, just a really clean cup. Is the hazelnut flavor killing any attempt at genuine coffee sweetness? Is there a “better” way to handle the ground, flavored coffee you buy at a grocery store?


My drip technique:


Remove carafe, pour water (plus 10 grams) in the tank. Put in paper filter, add coffee. Run machine without carafe, let basket fill up half way and give it a good stir with a spoon. Insert carafe somewhere at the point that I can time the drain from the basket as happening at the same time the water runs out of the tank. Immediately take the carafe off the heater.","What to do about flavored coffee?

Iced Coffee Suggestions for Small Cafe,"Hello, I manage a small cafe/teahouse and we are really wanted to start serving iced coffee as it is something our patrons request regularly. We serve Rombouts espresso and it's just not convenient for us to rely on espresso pods to make iced coffee and as we are new to serving iced coffee, we didn't want to order special ground coffee all the way from Belgium (where the pods come from), and wanted to source locally or at least from somewhere that ships Canada wide. SO, I'm looking first for brand suggestions and also for storage suggestions. 

Before I started at my current job I was a manager at McDonald's for seven years and we made iced coffee daily with our regular brew x2 and stored it in a tank with ice, and at the end of the night we dumped whatever was left. We are a small business here and try not to waste where we can so making a large quantity and keeping it out all day is not something that is really feasible to us. I had thought of brewing coffee regularly, letting it cool and keeping it in the fridge for a certain amount of time. I drink coffee, I love iced coffee myself but I'm not that big of a coffee fiend that I could tell you whether or not a coffee tastes ""old"" or ""burnt"". We pride ourselves on serving really great drinks and want to hit it right. So I'd love to know what you think our best option might be in regards to storage time or if we should brew regularly and just refrigerate. I've considered cold brew but it doesn't seem as cost effective as regularly brewed coffee. 

Many thanks for any advice!","Iced Coffee Suggestions for Small Cafe Hello, I manage a small cafe/teahouse and we are really wanted to start serving iced coffee as it is something our patrons request regularly. We serve Rombouts espresso and it's just not convenient for us to rely on espresso pods to make iced coffee and as we are new to serving iced coffee, we didn't want to order special ground coffee all the way from Belgium (where the pods come from), and wanted to source locally or at least from somewhere that ships Canada wide. SO, I'm looking first for brand suggestions and also for storage suggestions. 

Before I started at my current job I was a manager at McDonald's for seven years and we made iced coffee daily with our regular brew x2 and stored it in a tank with ice, and at the end of the night we dumped whatever was left. We are a small business here and try not to waste where we can so making a large quantity and keeping it out all day is not something that is really feasible to us. I had thought of brewing coffee regularly, letting it cool and keeping it in the fridge for a certain amount of time. I drink coffee, I love iced coffee myself but I'm not that big of a coffee fiend that I could tell you whether or not a coffee tastes ""old"" or ""burnt"". We pride ourselves on serving really great drinks and want to hit it right. So I'd love to know what you think our best option might be in regards to storage time or if we should brew regularly and just refrigerate.

Help deciding on how to start.,"I’m wanting to dip my toe into drinking coffee. I’ve had some before and I’ve had mixed feelings on it. My main thing is I am debating whether to go the route of a French Press or Pour Over. I don’t want to invest too much and decide it’s really not for me. 

When it comes to the coffee, it seems a lighter cup with cream and sugar is the way to go for me as I can’t stand it straight up. Both methods seem to work for me, but I’m leaning on French Press do to the lower cost of entry.  

I am extremely grateful for any help or suggestions and if I am not clear in question, please ask me to clarify.","Help deciding on how to start. I’m wanting to dip my toe into drinking coffee.

Upgrading grinders from a C2,"Okay, so the good ol' Timemore C2 has been my workhorse for about a year now, but now I know coffee is becoming a full blown obsession, I'm considering looking at using it as a travel grinder and getting something new for more daily use. 

I'm mainly brewing Moka Pots, Aeropress and V60 with the occasional French Press, so grinding fine enough for espresso isn't necessary but would be a nice bonus if/when I delve into espresso, I'm also not fussed about hand grinding Vs electric as I don't mind the manual work. The main qualities I'm looking for is being able to grind up to about 60g of coffee at once (so I could theoretically do a 1L french press), good grind quality at a decent speed, and easy cleaning.

Anyone got any recommendations? I am UK based and budget would stretch up to maybe £250.","Upgrading grinders from a C2 Okay, so the good ol' Timemore C2 has been my workhorse for about a year now, but now I know coffee is becoming a full blown obsession, I'm considering looking at using it as a travel grinder and getting something new for more daily use.

Oat and almond milk in cappuccino have a weird/bitter/burned taste,"Hello!

I was wondering if anyone else has the same experience as me. I've been drinking plant milks for years but for some reason every time I mix oat milk or almond milk with espresso it tastes disgusting. Kind of burned or bitter... Not sure how to describe it.

Becoming an all-round coffee nerd (with inspiration from the Q Grader Certification),"Hi everyone, I'm pretty deep into the coffee world at this point, but purely as a hobbyist. I love learning more about things on the side so I thought, *I wonder if there's a course I could do that goes really deep on this stuff?* 

And naturally after some research I found the Q Grader Certification. But that's for really serious professionals, with a high cost and high barrier to entry. I don't want to go that far. But I'm inspired by the breadth of knowledge that's necessary to be certified. I'd love to get maybe half way there purely for fun as a hobbyist, without too much monetary pain or having to take exams. I also don't think the Q Grader course goes too much into different brewing methods (that's not the point) but for the home enthusiast I'd want to focus there too.

So with one eye on this [useful course summary I found](https://www.coffeestrategies.com/q-grader/q-grader-course/), and tweaking substantially for my interests, here's my proposed at-home syllabus:

**General coffee knowledge**
* Read a well-regarded book about each of: cultivation / harvesting, processing, cupping, roasting and brewing.
* Solid understanding of the impact of bean origin.
* Solid understanding of the coffee supply chain and cost / pricing mechanisms (I'm an econ nerd), including both commodity grade and specialty coffee.
* Put James Hoffmann's *The World Atlas of Coffee* on my bookshelf so people know I mean business.

**Roasting**
* Buy a roaster, burn a bunch of beans, then stop burning them and actually start roasting well.
* Solid understanding of and ability to identify roasting defects.
* Ability to roast various origins and varietals to the correct roast levels. 

**Cupping / Tasting**
* Comprehensive understanding of the various cupping protocols.
* Solid understanding of the impact on water on cupping, and the ability to identify where water is causing issues.
* Ability to identify different intensities of sweet, salty and sour solutions (inspiration from [here](https://www.coffeestrategies.com/q-grader/sensory-skills-exam/))
* Familiarity with the Le Nuz Du Cafe scents (or equivalent).
* Comfortable in scoring a coffee using the SCAA Coffee Cupping Form (acknowledging the subjectivity in this, and fact you'd never get close to professional level)

**Brewing** 
* Comprehensive understanding of making espresso, e.g. the impact of grind, ratio, distribution, temperature, pre-infusion, flow rate, pressure, dialing in, diagnosing poor technique.
* Solid understanding of two other brew methods (for me, Aeropress and v60). Able to experiment with different techniques and identify differences which result.

*Note: nothing in the above addresses green coffee grading - doesn't seem relevant enough for me as a home hobbyist.

"New to Bialetti Moka Express, some questions","Hi everyone,

This is my first post on this sub. After a year and a half of drinking Nespresso, I decided I wanted to try the Bialetti Moka Express. I had a few questions about this.

First, the directions mention using cold/room temperature water. But I've also read elsewhere that I should use hot water, because it cuts down on the brewing time, &amp; it prevents the coffee from tasting metallic. Is this true?

Second, what do you recommend the heat setting/length of time? When will I know when to turn it off and when the coffee is ready?

Third, should I use a cold towel/put the moka pot under cold running water to cool it after?

Fourth, I read on another website the following:

""Does The Moka Pot Make Espresso?

I know that moka pots are often referred to as “stovetop espresso makers”, but sadly, that description is a little... optimistic.

You see, espresso is made when hot water is forced through super fine coffee grounds at 8-10 bars of pressure. The moka pot is only capable of producing 1-2 bars.

It’s just not enough to really be called true espresso, though the result is definitely espresso-like.

The coffee is still intense, still heavy-bodied, and still good for making faux-espresso drinks like cappuccinos and americanos. But if you want to be able to make true espresso, you’ll need an actual espresso machine.""

So my question is, with this in mind, should I not use the Lavazza espresso ground coffee, then?



The directions were pretty bare-boned, so I'm trying to fill in some gaps here.","New to Bialetti Moka Express, some questions Hi everyone,

[Question][Gear] What's the best coffee grinder for around $200 NZD for filter coffee? (that isn't too loud),"Hi everyone!

For almost three years now I've been using a refurbished Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind burr grinder, and I fricking hate it. It creates loads of fines, it makes a big static-y mess, and worst of all it's painfully loud. So, it's time for an upgrade.

I'm in New Zealand, and my budget is roughly $200 NZD... roughly. Looking at the [the wiki's recommended grinders, the ones I'm considering are](https://reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear_by_price)

* The [Bodum Bistro](https://www.amazon.com.au/Bodum-Bistro-Electric-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B0043095WW/) for $153.69 NZD
* The [Baratza Encore](https://www.laffare.co.nz/shop/machines/grinders/baratza-encore/) for $260 NZD
* The [Breville Dose Control Pro](https://www.amazon.com.au/Breville-Bcg600Sil-Control-Grinder-Stainless/dp/B00MNJM1RG/) for $260.95. It's effectively a less-fancy option of the [Breville Smart Grinder Pro](https://www.amazon.com.au/Breville-Bcg820Bss-Grinder-Brushed-Stainless/dp/B071F7C193/), which is designed for espresso, but the wiki says it's good for filter coffee.

Also, my preference is for electric grinders, but I'm open to a hand grinder if it can grind 20 grams of light-roast coffee beans to a filter coffee size (V60) in under a minute, and is decently durable.

What do you think? Can I get a good, not-too-loud grinder for filter coffee at my price point? Any and all advice would be appreciated!","[Question][Gear] What's the best coffee grinder for around $200 NZD for filter coffee? (that isn't too loud) Hi everyone!

Upgrade Timemore C2 or get JX Pro for Espresso?,I've had a C2 for a year now and I like it. But now I want to take my first steps into espresso range and plan to get a Flair Signature (for the pressure gauge). The problem is that the C2 is not suitable for espresso because it takes forever to grind anything close to espresso. So I need an upgrade.

Can I save some money like that or would it be better to just get the JX Pro (which would cost about 100€ more than trying to upgrade the C2).,Upgrade Timemore C2 or get JX Pro for Espresso?

Pour Over Ratio 1:25,"I recently discovered that i have been grinding finer and finer for my pour overs as i prefer a balanced, less sharp and sour coffee in my V60.
I ended up using 24g down to 20g for 600ml of coffee (2x300ml cups).
calculating that i not only am i on the aeropress range of my wilfa svart, but also finer than what timemore is recommending on my chestnut c2.

the resulting coffee is sweet, balanced cup that has still a good body that i am looking for.

i don‘t add milk or sugar but when i try a 1:16 on a wilfa svart „filter“ setting, i can barely stand it, all the nuances are gone and i just taste sour and bitter where i would strongly prefer to lessen the impact with milk.

Time vs temperature vs grind size for more extraction,"Most of the guides I read say that (1) higher temperatures, (2) longer brew times, (3) finer grind, these all increase extraction, leading to more flavor but also bitterness. 

My question is: keeping extraction ""constant"" what are the differences between the two? Like, if I decrease temperature but increase brew time an appropriate amount, how does it taste different?

I've seen some comments here that describe coffee extraction in terms of chemistry, as a first order rate process, but then coffee has many solutes that extract at different rates; at the extremes you have cold brew which tastes very different even if caffeine content was identical. Most people say ""just experiment"" but I'm kind of a coffee noob with an underdeveloped palate and I'm not that sure what I should be tasting.","Time vs temperature vs grind size for more extraction Most of the guides I read say that (1) higher temperatures, (2) longer brew times, (3) finer grind, these all increase extraction, leading to more flavor but also bitterness.

Considering upgrading from my modded Dedica Delonghi to a Rancilio Silvia E V6,"TL;DR at the bottom. This is my current setup more precisely:

**Grinder:** Wilfa CGWS-130b. **Espresso machine:** Delonghi Dedica EC685.

**Modifications:** Rancilio Silvia V1 steam wand (one hole) + Bottomless portafilter (nonpressurized)

(I also have a water filter jug, a distributor and a steel tamper.)

I am looking into the Rancilio Silvia E V6 (machine) + Rocky (grinder) combination, because I want to make richer espressos and smoother milk, of course. 

I am mostly curious about the espresso with this upgrade. I *know* the milk steaming will be so much better with three holes at the Silvia steam tip, so there's no question about the value there.   
(I have a good amount of experience (6 months) with a La Marzocco Linea PB (Rather spoiled at work), which has four holes at the steam tip). 

However, let's pretend that the only upgrade I got was getting an *actual* espresso grinder e.g. getting a Rancilio Rocky (the Wilfa model at best only does moka pot fineness, and besides it's not even a stepless grinder). **Would such an upgrade ""suffice"" as far as getting richer espresso is concerned?** I suppose what I am really asking is ""how big"" an upgrade would *that* be value-wise compared to *also* getting a ""better"" espresso machine? 

This leads me to another question: **Assuming I know exactly what I am doing; and that I am using an espresso grinder; and that I am using all equipment to its fullest potential, then** ***what would I be able to accomplish*** **with a Silvia** ***which I could never accomplish*** **with a modded Dedica?

Best Cabinet/Countertop Latte machine?,"So I’ve always liked Chai Tea Lattes. Usually from Starbucks or other coffee shops. 

Until I had a REAL chai tea latte from a local Indian coffee/deli shop last week. 

Holy cow the difference. It was AMAZING. Not a sugar overload. Just straight flavor, and spice, and fantastically smooth. 

My wife and I are hooked. I’ve looked up recipes (and the cafe was even nice enough to explain how they generally make theirs) and it seems that it can take quite a while to make these by hand. With 3 kids and work it can be hard to have time to do that prep in the mornings. 

However, we happen to be in the middle of a large kitchen remodel. We have space to put in an in-cabinet or countertop latte machine. 

Are there any good latte machines out there that would help in making these at home a little quicker? 
I came across Chime, but it seems that’s solely for Chai Tea Lattes and is pod-based. 
I would like to get something that isn’t pod-based (I hated having a Keurig), and that we can use to make a number of different drinks if we wanted to as well. 

I’m new to all of this, so please any ignorance I have on this.

Best brew method for a fruit bomb experience,"Hi all- I am long on the hunt for an elusive coffee that just tastes like a straight up fruit bomb. I’ve never been able to find one but admittedly I haven’t really seriously searched beyond my local roasters in Philadelphia. 

My question is regarding brew method. Once I get my hands on what should be a coffee with tons of fruit notes, is a Chemex ok? At home, I use a Chemex, white/bleached filters, 190°F water (filtered only from the filter in my fridge water dispenser), ~16:66 water:coffee ratio. I use a Krups burr grinder and set it on their recommendation for pour over (I think it’s between a 4-5 on the little dial. I’m not home now otherwise I’d confirm for sure!). I pour the first bit of water in (2x the bean weight) and let it sit for about a minute to bloom, then usually pour in the rest of the water in increments, about 100-150 g water at a time depending on how much in a rush I am.  I give the water a swirl so the grinds stay towards the bottom of the filter.","Best brew method for a fruit bomb experience Hi all- I am long on the hunt for an elusive coffee that just tastes like a straight up fruit bomb.

My coffee machine grinds for too long,"Hi guys,

First time I’m ever writing a Reddit post though I’m a long time lurker :)

I have a de longhi Eletta cappuccino top; it’s about one and a half years old. It has, most recently developed a weird habit - it grinds for way too long. Even when I adjust it to short coffee and extra-mild taste, it grinds for ages - roughly as long as you’d expect for an extra-long extra-strong coffee. If already tried fiddling with the coarseness but that didn’t yield any results.

For now, I can circumvent the issue by just filling in a spoonful of coffee every time I want a coup - which means the coffee machine, when making my cup, grinds the small quantity of coffee I actually need, and afterwards a lot of thin air.

Is the control board broken, or could there be another reason, or any other fix I could try before shelling out for a repair?

Would be grateful for any suggestions- or any pointers if this is not the right sub for this type of question :)","My coffee machine grinds for too long Hi guys,

Profitec Pro 300 tripping GFCI,"Hi all, 

I just purchased an open box Profitec Pro 300 and I have been having issues with the device tripping my GFCI. Here's a scenario I experienced:

Turned machine on
Waited ~10 minutes
PID read 93C (which was the configured temperature)
Turned on the brew switch, 
Brewed for 23 seconds
Hit the brew switch to off
GFCI tripped

I then tried again three separate times and it functioned properly, waiting each time for the PID to read 93.

The fifth time, I did not wait until the PID read 93, but instead was in the high 60s, hit the switch on, after a few seconds, hit the switch off and the GFCI tripped.

I have had occasions where I'd purge the machine after cleaning the portafilter and it would trip the GFCI.

It does not trip the breaker when plugged into another circuit (but it trips other GFCIs on the same line). It only happens when switching off the brew switch.

"DIY water tips, what Kh source, calcium and magnesium proportions and levels do to taste etc.","After using Third Wave Water for about two years, and often diluted around 50% the last year, I decided to try do-it-yourself water. My first attempt seemed okay and it is a different taste in the coffee, but I want to learn how the different minerals affect taste.

My first attempt targeted       40 ppm kh alkalinity with baking soda, 70 total permanent hardness equally magnesium and caclium via epsom salt heptahydrate and calcium chloride anyhdrous (note, the minerals were not equal in measurement but equal in the end result of hardness they would add which took almost twice as much magnesium heptahydrate since it has more water molecules in it than anhydrous calcium chloride.) 

From what I can gather based on the measurements of ingredients in TWW its profile is: 40 to 50 ppm alkalinity kh and 135 to 160 total hardness about 88% magnesium 12% calcium.  So diluted 50% would be 20 to 25 alkalinity and 70 to 80 hardness.  

I tried two coffees and compared to same brew parameters they were more airy and clean than the same with 50% diluted TWW.  Their sweetness was more background and lighter.  The TWW brewed coffee had more direct sweetness.  I liked aspects of both.   


From what I have read magnesium brings out sweetness where calcium brings out creamy texture.  I could see how the smooth, airness I got in the 50/50 magnesium calcium might have come from calcium.  Perhaps the lack of direct sweetness was from the higher alkalinity?  I noticed when I use TWW 100% it is often creamier, maybe from 40 to 50 alkalinity toning down acidity, but still more sweet from the higher magnesium.  


How do others find alkalinity and hardness and whether hardness is calcium or magnesium affects taste?","DIY water tips, what Kh source, calcium and magnesium proportions and levels do to taste etc. After using Third Wave Water for about two years, and often diluted around 50% the last year, I decided to try do-it-yourself water. My first attempt seemed okay and it is a different taste in the coffee, but I want to learn how the different minerals affect taste.

My first attempt targeted       40 ppm kh alkalinity with baking soda, 70 total permanent hardness equally magnesium and caclium via epsom salt heptahydrate and calcium chloride anyhdrous (note, the minerals were not equal in measurement but equal in the end result of hardness they would add which took almost twice as much magnesium heptahydrate since it has more water molecules in it than anhydrous calcium chloride.) 

From what I can gather based on the measurements of ingredients in TWW its profile is: 40 to 50 ppm alkalinity kh and 135 to 160 total hardness about 88% magnesium 12% calcium.  So diluted 50% would be 20 to 25 alkalinity and 70 to 80 hardness.

Broadening Coffee Horizons (but I only like cold brew),"Like the rest of the world, two years ago, when we went into lockdown/wfh, I had to quickly figure out how to make cold brew - I don’t really enjoy hot drinks and espresso wrecks my stomach.

I ended up getting a Toddy (which I love - so simple to use) and a subscription to the percolator pre-ground Taste coffee subscription. I guess my palette grew because the next time I went to Starbucks, the cold brew tasted… flat.

So - I want to start developing more of an appreciation for coffee but… again, I am kind of limited to cold brew. I noticed most roasters don’t sell preground - which I understand.

"""Work perk"" mystery bag","A friend got a bag of coffee from work as a ""perk."" No idea where it is from. She said she didn't like it, but couldn't articulate why, and suggested I try some.

I am not sure if this comes across, but the color ranges wildly. Individually, some beans look great for a light, medium, or even dark roast. Others are very dark, but still have their silver skin intact somehow. Some are just straight up burnt. Others have splotches of burned portions.

The smell: opening the bag, it smells like an ashtray. I'll be generous and say I also detect notes of anise and apple.

Broke my Kalita Wave,"I broke my glass Kalita wave the day after I ran out of filters for my V60. And for a few days I’ve been brewing Aeropress, even got a chemex in there. But I missed my V60/Kalita. With plenty of filters left over from the Kalita, I decided to Frankenstein a Kalita wave filter into my V60 with the last of an Ethiopian I had. 

And I was scared the entire time that the flat bottom filter would just blow out and load my carafe with coffee grinds but it never happened. I had a great brew (21g, 3:30 brew time) and drinking it now, it’s such a clean brew. Almost better than when brewed on their individual brewers with their own filters. 

Anyways, nothing constructive or helpful here, but if you’re in a pinch, a Kalita Wave 185 filter will work in a V60 size 2.

"Oxo small cold brewer doesn't seem broken, just doesn't work?","just looking for advice from another owner of the Oxo small cold brewer. the system seems pretty simple. there's a tank into which the ground coffee goes. above it is a shower head type barrier with holes that you pour water into. at the bottom is a plastic filter and gasket to  prevent leaks. this has a spring loaded gizmo at the bottom that is supposed to let water drop through that releases when it's set on top of the carafe.

the problem is, the spring loader fully opens and the water just falls through instantly. there's no brewing over time. it just delivers dirty water a few seconds after you pour it in. that's it.

the only way to get anything decent out of it was  to remove the tank and lean it in a pot so the water has a chance to do its magic. I did this overnight and then re mounted the tank on the carafe. coffee rushed through and that was that.

something is clearly amiss. but it doesn't seem broken. it just seems terribly designed. but this thing gets good reviews. maybe I'm wrong and  the spring loaded deal is effed?

can someone please help me asses whether my teapot is genuine (and good quality)?
I bought it in a shop downtown and the price was low due to mechanical damage that happened to the lid (not seen on photos). My idea is to eventually get it kintsugi repaired, I know a guy who is schooled in that.
The teapot looks similar (not identical though) to the pots they use in a different local teahouse run by a trustworthy chinese owner. The material of my teapot also looks and feels simlar to the pots in the other teahouse, it feels good quality.
However I got little concerned when I looked at the stamp... I cant read Chinese, but the characters look odd on the stamp, it made me suspicious that the teapot might be fake.

Gao Shan Woolong - Vegan?,"Hi everbody,

I just bought a Gao Shan Woolong (Milk Oolong) 2 weeks ago. The seller said it is vegan, but I am not sure about this. 

He told me the tea is from Ali Shan and the plant is called QuinXin. At my insistence, he asked his importer, who told him that the tea was flavored by natural aroma. The flavoring oil used is supposed to mimic milk and osmanthus, but supposedly does not contain milk itself. I don't quite trust all that, though. Further inquiries to the seller are unfortunately futile. Searching the internet, I found both unflavored and flavored tea. The flavored tea but then steamed with milk (so no oil?). Do any of you know if the flavored oils used are vegan or if any are used at all?

What kind of pitchers do you all prefer?,"Hi there everyone,
A year ago i really started to get into drinking tea, mostly for health and mood reasons. Now, it's something I very much enjoy. 

Initially I had a really nice electric kettle that I loved. Then, earlier this year, it some how got a giant crack in it's glass, and not being able to spend another $98 on a new one I opted for a stove top kettle. I also enjoy this but i do miss the temperature control that the other had.

When I would make my tea, I normally just drink it hot. I would steep it in a container and then just leave it on the counter to come back to through out the day. For a long time I would use something like this.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013Z9NY0/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_i_N7610QN3GMFTSG880QEJ

I can not stress enough how much I -HATE- this thing. Sure, for storing water to keep cold, it works well. My great grandma always had one in the fridge. For tea it sucks. If you're using loose leaf tea or any kinda tea bag that leaves behind particulates this thing gets all gunky and it's a pain to scrub clean. 

I got tired of it and decided to use the plastic orange juice pitcher, till i found something better, preferably made from glass. Well that time is now, because somebody melted the pitcher on the stove top. 

My kettle says it holds 3 liters, but I suspect that's if you fill it well above the fill line. That container that melted, I can't see it being anything more than 2.5 liters. I'll have to meassure how much my kettle really holds later today.  I'm looking for something that's temperature resistant glass, holds enough for my kettle, and is not a pain to clean. 

I was hoping that some kind folks here might have suggestions regarding what they like. Thank you &lt;3","What kind of pitchers do you all prefer? Hi there everyone,

Thompson's Irish Breakfast is the only Irish Breakfast tea for me,"I grew up in N. Ireland drinking Punjana, but rather late in life I discovered Thompson's Irish Breakfast. It's not a mild, gentle tea: no, this is builder's tea, strong tea, 'it's 4AM and I have to be awake and alert' tea.

I didn't know nor care what was in it, but the slightly seaweedy aroma of a freshly-opened bag reminded me of the dulse they sold at the fair. The taste, though... It always started with a fragrant, floral note with a hint of bitterness, before the maltiness smacked me in the mouth and made me growl in appreciation. It *needed* milk; you could not drink this straight or your mouth would dry up. My mother always left the teabag in her mug, but that was too much for me.

These days... well, either my tastebuds have been damaged, the suppliers have changed or the water at home's too chlorinated, but it's no longer quite as powerful. My mother, due to cutting down on the caffeine, has to drink their decaf, which is just barely acceptable. Still, every time I go back I pick up a box or three of both the Irish Breakfast and Decaf, and I'm always sad when it's gone.

Local substitutes? Only Yorkshire Gold came close, but I found the Pump Room Blend from Wiltshire Tea with a little of their Rwandan gave me the strength I was looking for once more. Not exactly the same, but close enough.","Thompson's Irish Breakfast is the only Irish Breakfast tea for me I grew up in N.

Still, every time I go back I pick up a box or three of both the Irish Breakfast and Decaf, and I'm always sad when it's gone.

Looking to buy loose leaf teas but I'm not sure how I steep without a tea bag? I seen the little glass things people use but I have a gas stove and worry about glass not holding up to a flame.,"So how does it work? How do I steep?

The ones I found that did mention the process were catered to electric stoves with the little glass kettles that look awesome.

A couple questions I didn't find answers to in the wiki,"Hi!

Long time tea fan, now getting into more interesting / premium stuff. 

1) I have some some excellent loose leaf tea I got with a gaiwan, so naturally I want to brew it gong-fu style. Problem is that some of them have a recommendation of using amounts of water that are more than the gaiwan can hold. To get the best results, should I scale down water + tea amount proportionally, or is it better to use the recommended water + tea amounts with a bigger cup and don't use the gaiwan?

2) I have some mate (not a tea, but still). I don't have a filtered straw, or the special glass for it. The packaging recommends brewing it western style, for like 5 minutes, but reading online thats not at all how its usually drank. Worth buying a kit for it or is it pretty close already? I really like it so far. 

3) What do I do if I'm drinking a loose leaf tea that can do 12 or even more infusions, but I don't have time to drink them all, or can't share it with others? Can I just put it away, and use it the next day? Feels like being wet could cause it to become worse maybe. Store in fridge/just leave it outside/let it dry, but cover it/...?

Maybe I'm just overthinking it haha. Thanks for any help 🍵","A couple questions I didn't find answers to in the wiki Hi!

trying 2010 and 15 Xiaguan and Dayi / Taetea tuochas,"I recently wrote about shifts in consumer preference related to sheng pu'er, about style and pricing changes.  This continues from that, exploring if there is an inexpensive way to have related experience, that doesn't involve spending $80 to 100 on higher quality, natural arbor sourced sheng versions (or $50 for something presented as of more modest quality, or at least better value).  

These are ""factory teas,"" less expensive and different versions / style, with tuocha a reference to the shape, compressed into a ball, or bird's nest shape really.  They don't cost much; I just saw a newer Dayi / Taetea version listed for $6 (for 100 grams), and finding somewhat aged versions for around $10-15 isn't so unusual.  Not truly aged though, which are in higher demand.  This style of tea transitions to a warmer, milder, more complex flavor and character range after about 15 years, and bitterness and astringency switch over to other flavor and feel.  This describes what it's like trying them halfway through that transition process, at 7 and 10 years old.

Pu-erh tea cake giveaway to those who lost tea packages on 5/19/2020,"Today we were contacted by Crimson Lotus with an unusual request.  They wished to post a notification of a special service they are offering to those of our community that were hit by the mass disappearance of tea shipments from China (from a number of companies) on May19th, 2020.  Many people lost their shipments and some small tea companies lost significant money refunding their customers for these orders.  The disappearance was never explained by the shipping companies.

Because this technically violates the self-promotion rules of /r/tea we asked that Crimson Lotus post [this notification in the weekly Marketing Monday thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/uqtr9i/marketing_monday_may_16_2022/i94xq85/).  However, the event is set to occur on May 19th on the anniversary, so waiting for next Monday would make the notification too late.

We have compromised on posting the notification on this week’s Marketing Monday thread, but calling attention to it with this post.  This is an unusual enough offer, beneficial to many members of the /r/tea community, that we couldn’t resist working with Crimson Lotus to trumpet this event.

I finally had the time to brew tea again and I decided to try the sample of Genmaicha I bought from Grand Tea &amp; Imports. I don't know if it's the way they display the tea in glass jars or if it's the quality of this grade of genmaicha but it tasted pretty average. I'm definitely interested in recommendations.

I found it a little nutty, as you'd expect, and surprisingly naturally sweet. I think I like it slightly more than soba because of the sweetness. My mom was much harsher but she likes her tea strong. She'll let it steep for hours. 

I didn't get a lot of rounds from my 100ml gaiwan so I've spent the rest of the tea drinking old mint tea with ice and agave. I think the mint might be on its last legs but I feel bad just throwing it out.","Genmaicha &amp;#x200B;

Double sealing Harney tins?," I have quite a few tins from Harney and Sons, however they have generally been on the lower end of the price range except for keemun ""Hao Ya A"", which I fill from a bag and go through pretty quickly.

Harney tins only have the outer lid with no inner lid. I would prefer not to buy more double sealed canisters for things that already come in cans, or put them in bags when they already come in tins and attractive ones at that. 

I am wondering if there might be a good way to seal the tins without changing them, like an aftermarket solution where I can buy maybe rubber squares of the right size or something I can cut to the right size or something like that?

Who else was lucky enough to snatch a 30gram bag of this Japanese white tea from Yuuki-cha?,"It's the only white tea they have and it sold out in about a week. A little on the expensive side also for being $17 for only 30 grams. It was only in stock one time since as long as I have been shopping on yuuki-cha, which was march 2020 when the pandemic started. 

It is such an honor to have tried this white tea. MORE than worth the $17+$25shipping that I paid. SUCH an honor! 

The FIRST CUP has this beautiful light subtle umami sweetness, very similar to a light sencha. It's like you're drinking sencha but it has been turned into a white tea. I use 6 grams of tea in a larger gaiwan, 4oz of water at 160F for 2 minutes. I can get 5 good steeps out of it, could even push 6 steeps. The last steep I add 10 seconds more. DEVIIIIIIIIIIIINE!!!!!!

My latest haul from Harney and Sons,"I needed more tea and checked out Harney and Sons' website. I haven't tried any of these yet, but they smell so good. 

I love peach iced tea, so the Invigorating Peach Fresh Brew Iced Tea bags sounded perfect. The box [contains ](https://imgur.com/gallery/h02ZoJH) 3 large pouches of tea that brew 2 quarts of iced tea each. The peach scent was noticeable before I even opened the box, and it's very strong through the sealed plastic bag. Chinese black tea mixed with Georgia peaches. The peach scent is very natural and mouthwatering. 

I always have a bit of trouble trying to figure out how much tea to use for a big pitcher of iced tea, so I hope these pouches will be perfect. It was $6US, and H&amp;S also carries larger quantities that are even less expensive. 

I love Darjeeling and Assam so Stanley's Blend of the two was too tempting. It was also on sale for $8.50US.

Harney and Sons has these little loose leaf samplers of a lot of their teas, usually $4US, so I bought a few. The Cherry Blossom green tea with cherry and vanilla was on sale for $3.20US. 

They sent me two free samples--Ceylon &amp; India Orange Pekoe tea bag and a silken pyramid bag of Chamomile. 

I'm not sure if I'm supposed to whisk the matcha as it's not a powder [tea looks like this](https://www.harney.com/products/white-peach-matcha?variant=39404095307847) 

I love that Harney and Sons shows photos of the tea leaves and their optimal brew. It's extremely helpful.

What kinds of tea to replace caffeinated soda?,"Hi folks! I just discovered this subreddit &amp; I cannot wait to delve in! First though, is the reason I was looking for a tea subreddit to begin with. I have a question that I'm trying to help my husband with.

He would like to start laying off the Coke Zero (and Cherry Coke Zero &amp; no sugar Dr. Pepper, ect). I've told him I will gladly make him tea (probably iced tea?) to replace the soda, but now we need to find an acceptable replacement. It needs to be caffeinated. Also, he likes things on the sweeter side (I'm sure we can work down from there, but starting off too bitter will probably be a turn-off &amp; I'd like for this to be successful for him.) 

I've been buying loose leaf teas for years &amp; years so he's seen me drinking my happy green tea every day. He'd just like to see if I can help him find some types that he would like.

I am at a loss as to how to even begin to find something that has a chance of replacing the soda.

Preferred Way to Brew Sencha,"I was gifted 100g of extremely high quality sencha and am looking for insight on the best way to brew it. I'm seeing a ton of conflicting info and a lot of unmeasured methods.

I do a ton of pour over coffee so I am used to measuring both water and beans as well as dialing in water temperature and timing infusion.

I plan on brewing in a  700mL Hario maru kyusu with a fine wire basket. My kettle is a gooseneck kettle so the water flow is restricted and not as quick as a spouted kettle. Would this impact the timing of the infusion?

When doing second, third, and fourth infusions, do you adjust the amount of water? I am seeing info about lowering the infusion time of the second pour to about half the first pour and then the third infusion is often triple the time of the second infusion.

Any clarity on these topics is greatly appreciated.","Preferred Way to Brew Sencha I was gifted 100g of extremely high quality sencha and am looking for insight on the best way to brew it. I'm seeing a ton of conflicting info and a lot of unmeasured methods.

Similarities Between Qimen(Keemun) and Jin Jun Mei?,"Hello everyone! Today I was drinking Yunnan Sourcing’s Imperial Grade Qimen of Huangshan. This is actually my first time drinking Qimen after hearing so much about it, and was my mind blown! It had such a sweet chocolatey, malty taste, with notes of rose and cherry popping up as I was drinking. Definitely one of my favorite teas I’ve tried in a while.

But while drinking, I noted a striking similarity to some other Jin Jun Mei’s I’ve tried, particularly Mei Leaf’s Sweet Spice JJM. This got me thinking; Is this a normal comparison between these two teas? Does Qimen and JJM often taste similar, or is this just a similarity between these two batches? 

Either way I loved the Qimen, and I’m excited to try the Competition Grade Qimen I got from Yunnan Sourcing also in this order!","Similarities Between Qimen(Keemun) and Jin Jun Mei? Hello everyone!

It had such a sweet chocolatey, malty taste, with notes of rose and cherry popping up as I was drinking. Definitely one of my favorite teas I’ve tried in a while.

But while drinking, I noted a striking similarity to some other Jin Jun Mei’s I’ve tried, particularly Mei Leaf’s Sweet Spice JJM. This got me thinking; Is this a normal comparison between these two teas? Does Qimen and JJM often taste similar, or is this just a similarity between these two batches?

A guide to Yixing teapots and where to buy,"I’ve been a part of this sub for quite a while. Two things I see posted again and again are “where can I buy real Yixing?” And “Is this pot I got second hand real Yixing”. 

This post is an attempt to answer both of those as well clarify a lot of misconception about the craft in general. I spend most of my day authenticating and translating teapot seals and every summer I visit (not recently obviously) Dingshu town in Yixing China where the local artisans live and sell prefired pots. I feel I’m pretty knowledgeable. 

First some clarification. 

Yixing teapot refers extremely specifically to teapots constructed in a slab built (not thrown on a pottery wheel) method and of ore mined in and around the town of Yixing. This started with HuangLongShan mine and has expanded to others, then the government ceased mining operations at most sights. Pots are either fully hand made or half handmade. The names associated with this clay are ZiSha or ZiNi aka purple sand. There are many sub categories and specific types of clay such as DaHongNi but this is unimportant. Teapots made of other clay are not Yixing. Teapots that are injection mold slip casted are not Yixing. These pots will often have the name Yixing China stamped on the bottom though. 

This brings me to Yixing rule number one: If you bought a pot for less than 100USD. It’s not real sorry. This is the entry for half handmade pots. Fully handmade shoots that price up. Artist renown shoots it up more. You will not get Yixing for less than 100USD. Period. And those fancy sets with all the cups and poem on the box, those are the worst. 

Rule number two: if it doesn’t have a seal stamped on the bottom it’s not Yixing. The government controls pottery and works of registered artists are required to be stamped and their stamps are catalogued. If it just has a name carved into it or nothing it’s probably made in Taiwan or a fake cashgrab. 

Rule number three: if the pot is super ornate with carvings or nature scenes molded into it and you didn’t pay a hefty sum, it’s slip casted injection molded clay and fake.

So where can I get real Yixing? 

—Are you interested in function and want the best clay for enhancing tea without regard to it being “art” or one of a kind?

You want a vintage government backed factory pot. Ideally out of factory one during the 70s and 80s. Half handmade and have some liberties taken with craftsmanship but made of the best clay that is now no longer available. 

https://moodyguy.biz is the best for this. There are some others like “authenticYixing” but I personally trust this seller. 

—Do you not care so much about vintage or one of a kind and would like a modern pot centered in functionality made of authentic (but not factory one) clay?

Mud and leaves is the place to go they work with Chen Chunhong and his wife to ship in their half handmade pots. Good price, interviews with the craftsman, great craftsmanship.

— Do you want a work of art?

For modern but adhering to traditional standards and fully hand made on of a kind https://www.realzisha.com is the place. They video call with the nationally recognized and ranked craftsmen and have everything from rising apprentice works to master level potters. 

For modern and not adhering to traditional standards and form Yinchen studio is great. They offer some half and some fully handmade but they break a lot of rules in regard to teapot form and are like the modern art side of Yixing. 

Vintage fully handmade… sorry these are ridiculously expensive or on display in the national museum of Chinese art.

Now there are certainly other places to buy. I would strongly avoided these unless you are into the hobby and have done a good bit of research into authentication. The problem is that every other shop (Yunnan sourcing and the likes) don’t post the artist, clay type, or production method of their available pots. All the places mentioned above do, most having video interviews or videos of pots being made as well. 

Any further questions ask away!","A guide to Yixing teapots and where to buy I’ve been a part of this sub for quite a while. Two things I see posted again and again are “where can I buy real Yixing?” And “Is this pot I got second hand real Yixing”.

Tetsubin - makes a dufference?,"Hello fellow tea drinkers!

It buggs me recently - does boiling water in (cast) iron kettle really does make a difference when it comes to taste of tea? Im asking about kettle without enamel / glasure / coating inside, made to boil water in it.

Ive heared that boiling water in tetsubin helps to make green tea sweeter due to that little bit of iron transfered to water during boiling. Especialy when it comes to Japanese green tea.

Any tips on cutting down caffeine while still enjoying tea?,"I LOVE tea - green tea mostly, but also dabble occasionally in oolongs, blacks, and silver needle. Over the past year, this general enjoyment has also turned into a hobby - trying new varieties, enjoying traditional style handmade teaware, reading this sub, etc. However, I'm finding I drink quite a bit of caffeine, and for health reasons (trying to get pregnant) I would like to cut down. 

I'm wondering if anybody has any advice on cutting down on caffeine while still getting to enjoy tea? So far, switching to a smaller pot (a 125mL hohin, vs. my 250mL kyusu) makes me feel like I can drink enough cups of tea to be satisfied, but because the portions are smaller, it ends up being less tea overall. I would be interested in getting an even smaller pot and cup so I can continue with that same method.   
I'm also looking into lower caffeine teas to substitute for my full-caffeine favourites (gyokuro, sencha asamushi, korean semi-wild). Unfortunately the one kukicha I found I wasn't too keen on (could have been a lower quality?) and I prefer vegetal greens rather than the toasty notes of a houijicha.   


If anybody has any suggestions on small volume Japanese tea pots, or lower caffeine green teas, I'd be very grateful! Also appreciative of any general advice that has helped others.","Any tips on cutting down caffeine while still enjoying tea?

How sensitive is tea to odors and humidity really? Am I storing it good enough?,"I like high end first flush Indian teas and also have some fresh stuff from Teavivre. Is keeping the tea in its original resealable pouch in a cabinet good enough? For most of the them, I put them in a ziploc as well, so they are double sealed and I try to go a step further. 

If my window is open on a hot, humid  or rainy day, would it impact the tea? 

Sometimes cigarette stink seeps into my apartment from my neighbor as well🤢 which also makes me paranoid. 

I haven’t had any issues yet, but with the summer being here and the fact that it will take me several months to drink some of the teas (2-6 months+ depending on which ones I like the most)…I want to try to keep them nice as long as I can!","How sensitive is tea to odors and humidity really?

Feeling a Little Baffled by my Tea Efforts,"***Am I just not cut out for tea? Are my taste buds too weak? Any opinions or ideas are welcome.*** of savoring a non-caloric beverage. I have enjoyed tea at tea houses and occasionally iced tea in the past. So far, though, I feel really frustrated with how weak it is coming out. I'm using about 3 times as much tea as the retailer recommends, steeping for the max recommended time, and heating water to the recommended temperature. The teas are all... nice, I guess, but they mostly taste to me like hot water with a little bit of other flavors - and very few of those flavors are what I think of as that quintessential black tea flavor.

The retailer recommends one teaspoon ""per cup"" (which I understand typically means 6 ounces in the tea world). I have a 20 ounce teapot, so I'm using 2 tablespoons, AKA 6 teaspoons. That amount expands to fill the infuser basket most or all of the way.

I've also tried adding a very small amount of sugar, but that does nothing to bring out any flavor (just makes it slightly sweet).

These are the teas I've tried, and they were all too weak for me, though the flavors and their amount did vary between varieties:

I want to start using a teapot I found.,"It's a teapot that doesn't come with an infuser and, in fact, the size of the opening wouldn't really lend itself to the use of one anyway.

I've never brewed in a teapot before, and I am curious about the procedure.

Let's say I want to brew enough to have 2 or 3 cups of tea (loose leaf). 

Once it's brewed, I know when I pour I can use a strainer to make sure I don't get any leaves in my cup, but what about the tea that's still in the pot waiting to be drunk?  Won't the tea leaves sitting in it make the rest of the tea unpalatable due to a longer infusion time?

Do people use two teapots and pour from a brewing pot to a serving pot?

Should I not worry?  

Thanks!","I want to start using a teapot I found. It's a teapot that doesn't come with an infuser and, in fact, the size of the opening wouldn't really lend itself to the use of one anyway.

Brewing tea with less caffeine,"I've been working on a recipe for hard iced tea. My first attempt came out tasting good, but the caffeine content was so high, just a few glasses kept me up all night. I know I could use decaf tea but I have access to free regular Lipton black tea at my campus, so I'm wondering if there are infusion methods that yield less caffeine.

I steeped 6 bags of tea in two cups of vodka at room temperature for 3 hours, and then added simple syrup, baking soda, and a gallon of water. I'm starting to think that steeping in alcohol was a bad idea. Perhaps it drew out a lot more caffeine than water would have.

I know I've heard before that cold brewed coffee has more caffeine than hot coffee. But I've never heard anything about tea. Does anyone know what steep time and temperature might yield less caffeine? FYI, for this project I'm not super concerned about it being bitter, I can just use more baking soda or sugar.

I hope this is the right sub for a question like this. Thanks!","Brewing tea with less caffeine I've been working on a recipe for hard iced tea.

Stockholm syndrome tea?,"Over the years as I've drank more and more tea I've noticed something. The bitterness is gone.

So frankly, it got me thinking. Have any of you noticed this? How over time tea just stop tasting bitter in any way? Like your tongue is used to those tannins. I've always brewed my tea decently strong as a side note so maybe that affects something.

Water quality,"Hi fellow tea drinkers! Yesterday I brew my tea with mineral water for the first time and oh boy, does it make a difference...

I've always been brewing my tea in tap water boiled (or brought up to other temp) in your standard kettle, as tap water in my country is drinkable even raw (straight from tap). The taste of tea was always.. ok-ish. Could sense different notes of flavour, no chlorine taste or smell was present, overall nice experience.

Though when I drank tea in my local teashop the difference was always there. Talking about same tea cultivars from same year tasted there and in home, as they also sell the tea leaves they serve to guests. Teashop tea was always more reach and balanced. Always. I thought that they have some great know-how, since they are business. Well... turns out it probably was just water all along.

I used bottled mineral water, all other factors seemed the same to me. Tea got far more flavour, especially in those subtle notes which suddenly exploded from the infusion taste, it was overall more reach and balanced, like in tea shop.

So my dear fellow tea drinkers - make sure you have good water for your adventures with tea. Cheers!","Water quality Hi fellow tea drinkers! Yesterday I brew my tea with mineral water for the first time and oh boy, does it make a difference...

"I am looking for non-japanese matcha, any hints?","Despite trying a lot I can't stand even the slightest hint of umami flavor in Matcha (no need to recommend me to try xyz). But I've found that Cheap Chinese Matchas that you buy in supermarkets tastes great to me, but obviously: 1. I don't want mercury/lead poisoning and 2. I would like something nicer (but not with the Japanese flavor profile)

The Chinese invented this stuff without the whole shading shenanigans, then their culture was wiped and it disappeared, and it now re-appeared as cheap knockoffs of the Japanese version. However, I am assuming (hoping, rather) that there must have been a resurgence in the Chinese way of powder tea, but Google results get drowned out by Japanese stuff so I can't find anything and hence my question here.","I am looking for non-japanese matcha, any hints?

curious about teapots,"I'm looking to up my tea game by getting a nice cast iron teapot and I'm curious how having a teapot changes the experience, flavor, etc vs brewing a single cup of tea.

I'm most interested in cast iron, partially because I'm clumsy, i like their aesthetic more than glass or ceramic, and partially because I'm a cast iron fan for everything.

Are there any recommended brands? I would love one that the spout can actually pour a clean flow of water, and one that can hold 3-4 cups of tea (about 30 FL oz or 700-800 mL). Price point $100, but preferably $50. If possible having one not from Amazon would be great.

If you have something similar do you use it regularly or for special occasions? Do you have to brew only certain kinds of tea in it? I normally change the type of tea i have each day (black, oolong, puer, green varieties), is that alright in this type of pot? Are they too heavy to use a lot?

Teas raccomandations,"Hello! (skip to final paragraph if you don't mind my introduction)

I'm an Italian dude and I really enjoy drinking tea. I Have been drinking only the commercial one tho, the ones you find at markets, with clear taste exposed. 

One year ago I did some research, and bought some from twinings and Harney&amp;sons. From the first one i really enjoied their honey chamomile and dark caramel, and for the latter I loved their Paris tea. I've been disappointed tho by black teas (too smokey) and green tea (don't kill me please, it tastes like fish to me) and I also don't like twinings earl gray, everyday, english breakfast.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;it tastes like fish to me

Now that I made a fool of myself, i read on this sub that Teavivre it's really good in terms of price/quality, and i saw that the italian ship doesn't cost 10-20$ like in other sites, so it seems a very good option to me (correct me if i'm wrong) But it's the first time i buy loose leaf tea and I don't really know what to expect from the flavour part. Do you have any suggestions for me? while I was writing I saw they have samples, I could go rage mode and buy tons of samples but idk seems odd to me

"Review of four Bird &amp; Blend teas: Creme Egg, Birthday Cake, The Big Smoke, Coconut Milk Oolong","I got my second shipment of Bird &amp; Blend teas this week and have been quite amazingly impressed with every flavour.

In my first shipment I liked the teas, but none of them really wowed me. Peach Cobbler was too subtly flavoured/not very peachy, Cherry Bakewell was a bit tangy cherry, not much else, Dark Choc Chilli Chai was okay but didn't blow me away, Totally Nutty was quite good, but Bonfire Toffee (which I think is a great tea) just didn't somehow suit my tastebuds.

This time I got the following four teas:

* **Creme Egg Tea** - *Sri Lankan black tea, cocoa nibs, cocoa shells, jasmine blossom, sunflower petals, natural flavouring* - a really incredible tea that tastes like chocolate custard but is not remotely ""sickly"" or artificial, as many chocolate-flavoured teas can be. The jasmine is very subtle, I couldn't markedly detect it, but I feel it gives a slight floral hint/lift. As an experiment I brewed a cup adding a tiny bit of jasmine tea, and the extra jasmine actually didn't work, so I think they've got the balance perfect.

* **Birthday Cake** - *Rooibos (84%), Sri Lankan Black Tea, Sprinkles, Almond Pieces, Vanilla Pieces, Mallow Flowers, natural flavouring* - I'm not a huge fan of rooibos generally, but the almond in this really brings it together and it's an exceptionally smooth cup and much like Yorkshire Biscuit Tea, is somehow ""savoury"" rather than sweet.

* **The Big Smoke** - *Chinese pu-erh tea, ginger, lemongrass, lapsang souchong black tea, red peppercorns* - honestly one of the most fascinating and drinkable flavoured teas I've had. It's like a savoury smoky lemon chai. I will almost certainly be ordering this one again, as well as looking for similar blends.

* **Coconut Milk Oolong** - *Taiwanese milk oolong, coconut flakes, desiccated coconut* - this one is supposed to be brewed at 80c and the first time I made it I brewed it too hot, not letting the boiled water cool enough. This made it taste like bitter green tea not even an oolong. The second time I put some cold water in the cup first and the transformation was amazing. It's so smooth. I even managed to drink a cup of it without milk and didn't hugely struggle as I usually do with black/non-milk-added tea. The only thing I wonder about is whether the coconut could be a bit stronger? So I'm going to try adding some extra coconut to a future cup to see what that does.","Review of four Bird &amp; Blend teas: Creme Egg, Birthday Cake, The Big Smoke, Coconut Milk Oolong I got my second shipment of Bird &amp; Blend teas this week and have been quite amazingly impressed with every flavour.

Disturbing info about Yogi Tea being owned by a cult,"I just watched the first episode of True Believers (S1:E1 Empire of Yoga), a Vice series on cults, on HULU. 

The episode talked about Yogi Bhajan (Harbhajan Singh Khalsa) who came from India in the 60s and set up a big cult called [3HO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3HO?wprov=sfti1). Yogi Tea is one of the corporate entities of 3HO.

Yogi Bhajan encouraged his followers to move in together and form Ashrams. They were encouraged to buy houses and put them in the cult’s name. They were encouraged to work for the cult and to send their children to boarding schools 3HO set up in India. 

Some of the women have come out and said that they were sexually abused by Yogi Bhajan (he died in 2004, and his family now owns Yogi Tea and continues the cult). The children at the boarding schools were beaten regularly and went through a lot at the schools. While the Yogi’s family got rich, a lot of the supporters were very poor, living in squalor, and working for the cult.

I just thought Yogi tea was just one of the multiple regular tea companies on the market. I had no idea it had such a dark origin story.

I thought others would like to know and watch the episode for themselves. I have no problem with Yogis and SE Asian religions, but I do have a problem with organizations who take advantage of women and children. I thought others would like to know where their money is going. 

The people who head 3HO now deny any wrongdoing by Yogi Bhajan (even though he had multiple young wives brought up in the cult). 

There’s so many other brands out there, and it’s cool that there’s so many small independent companies we can patronize. Yogi Tea makes billions a year.","Disturbing info about Yogi Tea being owned by a cult I just watched the first episode of True Believers (S1:E1 Empire of Yoga), a Vice series on cults, on HULU.

Measuring Water Volume,"I need some help from any tea gurus out there!

So when I make a cup of tea with a tea bag that recommends 8oz of water, does it affect the taste if I pour my boiling water into a measuring cup and then pour it into my cup with the tea bag in it.

If so, should I just practice eyeballing my water amount so I’m pouring directly into the cup with the tea bag? (My electric kettle has a minimum water level of 0.5 liters.)

Any advice appreciated!","Measuring Water Volume I need some help from any tea gurus out there!

What is the best way to make tea?,"Hello everyone, 

I'm a tea drinker and I'm planning to buy some stuff to bring tea to work. On the same occasion, I wanted to learn how to improve my preparation skills to get a better result on my beverage of choice, so in that regard I have several questions: 

\- What do I need to make good tea? I'm using tea leaves (not bags) in a cup that is made to prepare to infuse the tea, but it prevents me from making more of it or even transferring it to another recipient. So I assume that I need a kettle and something to boil the water (maybe a 2 in one?). What do you recommend in that regard? I would like something durable (lifetime would be the best) and efficient, I don't mind paying a bit extra if it's not an incoherent amount.

\- Next, the leaves. The quality is a factor but how do I recognize the good stuff from the bad one? I'm already going to a specialized shop that got a tea that smells and tastes fantastic if I compare it with basics teabags. But I don't know if it's just an ok tea or if I'm wasting my money on expensive tea that isn't worth its cost. Here's a picture of what I bought for my earl grey: [https://i.imgur.com/NWobfjh.png](https://i.imgur.com/NWobfjh.png)

\- Finally, the technique. Right now I'm not doing anything particular, I boil water, pour it into my cup (in my particular case, it's already in) then add the tea leaves and let it infuse by itself for 5 minutes. Is there anything I should do or pay attention to? 

Oh, and if you have any advice for someone that drinks mostly earl grey and earl grey variations to try something new, I'm all ears.

Thx in advance to anyone that takes the time to read and/or answer me.","What is the best way to make tea? Hello everyone,

Electric Kettle Recommendations,"Hi! I looked around but didn’t find anything in the FAQ about this, so I figured it was safe to post. Can you guys recommend some electric kettles?

I had a Moosoo for a year that I loved. Of course, it’s not working now that the warranty has expired. If I plug it in, it just beeps and won’t stop or boil any water. I’m scared to just buy any brand now in case it breaks again so soon, so I’d love to know which ones YOU love if you use an electric kettle.

I would love another gooseneck. But, as I understand, it’s not as important because I don’t do pour over coffee. My priority is something that will last, has temperature control, and low budget if possible. I used the kettle maybe 1-2x a day. I only need to make 2 cups of water max at a time.

Question on Bai Mu Dan / White Peony Tea,"Hi all,

I've recently started drinking tea for the antioxidant benefits. 

I'm starting with white tea as it has a similar antioxidant amount per cup to green tea, but it's not quite as 'grassy' in flavour. 

I've bought a few Bai Mu Dan teas, but the leaves vary quite significantly in size and colour. 

Therefore, what constitutes a high-quality Bai Mu Dan? Assuming the same amount of silver needles, are you looking for smaller, greener leaves or is it irrelevant due to the fermentation process?

A few questions about how to brew thai tea and timing. I also plan to make other teas.,"I usually drink thai tea no milk. I usually make a large batch but the flavor is not perfect. I usually let it sit overnight to make the flavor strong. I am looking at brewing daily smaller batches now. I was looking at the moka pot , traditional way, french press. There are also infusers or tea maker pots. I want a strong aromatic flavor to my thai tea with the least amount of work possible but most important is the taste.  Many thai tea recipes/ drinks suck even at thai restaurants or even in thailand . (Been to thailand 3 times )  I am trying to make it like the thai place 30 mins away from my house. Its strong not bitter and sweet although I would use less sugar. I am not sure how she makes it and shes always to busy to ask when I go there if she will even tell me. I need help with the brewing method I think. How long do I let the tea boil for? How long to let it steep for strong flavor? I see many people putting the sugar in with the tea leaves as it boils. Does this do anything other than make sure it is dissolved? I see many places make sugar water syrup for the tea instead. Which sugar is best  palm, white, cane, brown, coconut etc? which brewing method would you suggest for the most flavor as that is most important? Thank You for your help!!","A few questions about how to brew thai tea and timing. I also plan to make other teas. I usually drink thai tea no milk.

"Too much new tea, to few caffeine free evenings","Hello everyone.

I've created a small ~~playlist~~  sampling list of raw pu'erh and more and ordered it from YS. Then the ""ZERO COVID"" policy came, so I had the impression that I will not see my teas again. Logically I've ordered some tea from Nannuoshan as consolation.

Today, I was presented with this:

Caffeine Levels of Various Brewed Japanese Teas (Test Results),"This may bore some of you to death, but for others this might be quite interesting. We had some of our teas sent to ""Element"" in Oregon and had them prepare an analytics report for us regarding the caffeine content of some of our brewed teas. 

We tested multiple teas at 2 different brewing conditions (one is with our recommended brewing instructions, and one is with boiling water).  See the below chart for the results.

Please keep in mind that this is just one set of results, from one lab, for some of *our* teas. Your sencha fukamushi or gyokuro might be very different. Leaf to water ratio, water temperature, steeping time, harvest time, growing conditions, tea processing, etc can all affect the final caffeine content in your brewed cup of tea, so there are many different factors at play.

want to make dandelion tea from my yard.. worried about neighbors possible use of pesticides or herbicides,"hey tea ppl,

ive seen that u shouldnt make dandelion tea from dandelions in ur yard if ur yard has been sprayed w pesticides or herbicides. i have not sprayed my lawn w anything. but all my neighbors keep up their lawns very well, they are well trimmed, bright green, and uniform. they have sprayed things on their lawns in the past. im not sure if they have this year, and im not gonna ask... im worried that the dandelions on my yard might have soaked up whatever these dumases might have paid their working class friends to spray on their side of the fence. dont ppl usually spray their lawns w stuff in the spring?

should i take a dandelion plant indoors and water it and give it compost so that it has a chance to clean out whatever it might have soaked up? i know roots make good tea, in case it goes to see and i cant brew from the petals anymore.

or maybe i should pick dandelions more in the center of my lawn, farther away from my neighbors lawns?

Teapot suggestion,"Hi all,

I’m looking for a gift for my partner. We drink tea most nights (loose leaf, black and herbal tea) and our teapot isn’t big enough for us to each have a big mug. Any suggestions?

I’d call us “casual” tea drinkers who don’t measure volumes, water temperature, etc, but we do time our brews a little. It’s a decompression routine for us to put the kettle on, make a pot, and relax at the end of the day. So for me the most important qualities in a tea pot are large (24 fl. oz or more), and will last a while. We are trying to be more intentional about buying durable goods.","Teapot suggestion Hi all,

Should matcha stains be removed from Chawan’s no matter what?,"Hi, so I’m pretty new to the world of ceramics, and I have a few questions. Recently I got two Chawan to drink my matcha. They leave a little bit of a stain after, but they come off pretty easy when I wash them by hand. I’ve heard from people that eventually some bowls will keep the matcha color in them, thus changing them a little. is that true? Also, would it really be a bad thing to let the bowl get “character” and “evolve” with the stain?
I own a few leather boots that I’ve used for some time, and the leather has gotten this patina to them that makes them look better in my opinion. Is it similar with Chawan bowls? 
Thanks guys! :)","Should matcha stains be removed from Chawan’s no matter what? Hi, so I’m pretty new to the world of ceramics, and I have a few questions.

Best Tea Filter For Gongfu?,"Hi everyone, up to now I've always used the generic stainless steel mesh semi conical filter like these

One problem is that they tend to get crud buildup around the weld where the metal meets the mesh. 

I'd like to find something better that is easier to keep clean and possibly imparts less flavor. The problem is that the ones that are solid metal or ceramic usually have little holes instead of mesh which allows more particulates to pass which is unacceptable.

I've been considering the funnel from the Keith titanium ti3911 coffee brewer which does have holes, but they seem really really small since their is 26,000 of them and they are laser cut conically so as to be easier to clean. But it's very expensive for a single piece of kit. Does anyone have anything better or some other recommendations? Thanks!","Best Tea Filter For Gongfu?

Best Machine for making Chai Tea Latte,"So I’ve always liked Chai Tea Lattes. Usually from Starbucks or other coffee shops. 

Until I had a REAL chai tea latte from a local Indian coffee/deli shop last week. 

Holy cow the difference. It was AMAZING. Not a sugar overload. Just straight flavor, and spice, and fantastically smooth. 

My wife and I are hooked. I’ve looked up recipes (and the cafe was even nice enough to explain how they generally make theirs) and it seems that it can take quite a while to make these by hand. With 3 kids and work it can be hard to have time to do that prep in the mornings. 

However, we happen to be in the middle of a large kitchen remodel. We have space to put in an in-cabinet or countertop latte machine. 

Are there any good latte machines out there that would help in making these at home a little quicker? 
I came across Chime, but it seems that’s solely for Chai Tea Lattes and is pod-based. 
I would like to get something that isn’t pod-based (I hated having a Keurig), and that we can use to make a number of different drinks if we wanted to as well.

Gaiwans need intensive care (maybe?),"My work gaiwans https://imgur.com/cpvW7F6 can use your help!

They were unfortunately left in the office this past Friday evening when a crew came through and disinfected desk surfaces. I have no idea what they used; all we’ve been told is it’s called “e-mist.” My boss packed the gaiwans up in the box you see behind them in the photo and put it all in an overhead storage. Supposedly, just the exposed desk surfaces are misted, so theoretically anything above that level would be untouched.

Having said all that, one of the gaiwans did have wet tea in it (it’s really dry here and it was overnight, so little chance for mold), and of course clay is porous and absorbs nearly everything. I mention this because it’s possible if any disinfectant reached this gaiwan, the wet tea would hold onto it.

As a precaution, I would like to clean these out but I’m unsure how to proceed.  Originally, I thought placing each one separately in boiling water for about 30 minutes would do the job, but I’d like to get input before I proceed. These gaiwans are well on their way to being wonderfully seasoned, so I’d like to avoid anything that would undo that, but of course food safety is the priority in this situation.","Gaiwans need intensive care (maybe?)

I made double power tea,"I've just opened the lost ark and I fear the treasures inside may be too much for mankind.

I made my tea like normal, and then I had the idea to put it back in the kettle and use the 1st infusion to make the 2nd infusion after the leaves cooled down all the way. It turns out I made tea that was twice as sweet and aromatic without adding any bitterness or astringency. when I exhale after a sip, it's nearly as strong as smelling the cold leaves directly. 

I am tempted to make triple and so on tea, but I'm not sure if my body can handle that level of unbridled tea power yet","I made double power tea I've just opened the lost ark and I fear the treasures inside may be too much for mankind.

Tea Colors - Lelow Online,"**Tea colors**

The botanical name for tea is Camellia sinensis, which comes from the family Camellia. This is the Chinese variety; in the northeast of India, a second variety known as Camellia assamica was discovered in the nineteenth century. The tea bush has leaves with finely serrated edges, with numerous oil glands. The flowers are white and have a delicate fragrance.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Tea Colours](https://preview.redd.it/zvwhoq8lnot81.jpg?width=575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23d10cc2169048185ae3ae7151d054fe8ebe6dbf)

The cultivation of tea requires a warm, humid climate, and cultivation at higher altitudes is considered to produce tea of superior quality, although factors such as the climate, soil, method of harvest, and processing also affect the tea quality.

The majority of teas are made from young leaves. When the bush reaches the necessary maturity, leaves are picked by hand. For the highest quality teas, only the top three newest leaves are picked.

After harvesting comes to the drying process. The leaves are spread out and left to wilt until they are very malleable and can be rolled without breaking. During this process is when the leaves release the substances that give them their characteristic color and smell.

**The giant forest**

In 1939, in the province of Yunnan in the southeast of China, a huge swath of wild tea trees were discovered. Some were more than 98 feet (30 meters) high with trunks 3 feet (a meter) in diameter. Their age is estimated to be around 1,700 years old.

**Modern and classic teas**

The custom of delicately flavored teas has been around for many years; however, fruity teas are a more recent trend and are often closer to an herbal infusion. The ideal choice is always a tea with a truly natural aroma and essence, such as those shown on these pages.

**Green tea**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ziztcyl2lot81.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=928c2ab6e6628712a339d45a7e97b552e1cb17fa

[Green tea](https://lelow.online/product/darjeeling-green-tea-100-grams/) is made by drying the leaves completely to avoid fermentation. It is the most common tea consumed in China and Japan. Along with white tea, it has the most proven therapeutic properties.

Green tea tends to have a more delicate and herbal aroma. It has very little theine or caffeine; depending on the variety, the quantity may be between 8 and 16 mg per cup. By comparison, a cup of espresso can easily have more than 200 mg of caffeine. Here are some of the most highly regarded varieties:

• Bancha. Alongside Sencha, although of lesser quality, it is the most common tea in Japan. Very low in theine.

• Genmaicha. Green tea with toasted rice; is frequently drunk with meals by the Japanese.

• Gunpowder. A Chinese tea with a strong flavor, which also appeals to fans of black tea. Often in the form of leaves compressed into a small ball.

• Kokeicha. Three-year tea; is very valued in Japan. It is made by toasting very fine twigs four times. Then the twigs are pulverized and pressed into fine needles.

• Kukicha. Made up of the stems of tea leaves, it makes a yellowish infusion with a distinctive flavor and very little theine.

• Lung Ching. This tea is the lung ching (“dragonwell”). It comes from the lake region of Hangzho, China. It is celebrated for its emerald color and sweet taste.

• Matcha. Powdered green tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony; yields a rich, astringent, jade-colored infusion.

• Sencha. A Japanese classic. Also available in a decaffeinated version.

Mu Tea. The so-called mu tea does not contain tea leaves; it is actually a unique mixture of sixteen plants and spices, revived in the last few decades from an ancient oriental tradition. It has a very particular taste and is wonderful for digestion. 

**Black tea**

&amp;#x200B;

[Black Tea](https://preview.redd.it/vy454dmjlot81.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5581839253ee765fe8c6de09adc881dfc2b9a1f)

[Black tea](http://lelow.online/black-tea/) is obtained through an oxidation process. Freshly harvested leaves are left in humid rooms so they ferment. This treatment lasts between three and five hours depending on the variety, which gives the tea its characteristic dark green or black color.

Black tea has a strong flavor—closer to coffee—and can be combined with milk. It has a higher quantity of caffeine than green tea has. Each cup contains between 25 and 100 mg, depending on the degree of fermentation.

Among the most popular varieties of black tea are:

• [Assam](https://lelow.online/product/halmari-tea-assam-ctc-buy-online-best-quality/). A full-bodied tea with a warm brown color. The Camellia assamica—a different plant than Sinensis—is grown in the northeast region of India.

• Ceilan. The ancient name for Sri Lanka is given to this delicate and aromatic black tea. It is commonly sold in bags.

• Darjeeling. Called “the champagne of teas” for its delicate fragrance and flavor. It is grown on the slopes of the Indian Himalayas. It is also sold decaffeinated.

• Earl Grey. Classic British mix of black tea with bergamot. It is one of the most commonly purchased bagged teas.

**Leaves from the sky**

The Darjeeling valley is found in the northeast region of India, on the border with Nepal. Eighty-seven tea plantations in this region have a 125-year history. The plant is grown at elevations between 1,970 and 7,050 feet (600 and 2,150 meters), on steep mountainsides that drain heavy monsoon rains.

The tea that grows in this region is of unmatched quality, a bundle of it falling somewhere between sweet grapes and ripe peaches. Between April and May the First Flush is harvested, tender young teas that produce a very light infusion. The second harvest, or Second Flush, occurs in July and August, and produces a bright infusion with a more intense flavor. This is considered ideal for after-dinner drinks.

• English Breakfast. Invented by a merchant in the nineteenth century, this is a very strong black tea to help you wake up in the morning.

• Keemun. From Chinese, “mountain of the lion.” This is a very high-quality tea grown in the humid mountains of Anhui. Its aroma is like that of an orchid.

• Kenya. Brightly colored and intensely aromatic, this is one of the black teas with the most body. It is grown at high altitudes in the African country and is usually sold as a powder.

• Lady Grey. This is a more fruity—and feminine—version of Earl Grey. In addition to bergamot it contains rose petal and orange peel.

• Lapsang souchong. This robust Chinese tea has a characteristic smoky taste, from the process of drying leaves over a wood fire.

• Samovar. A very popular mixture developed in Russia from Chinese black tea with a touch of smokiness.

• Sumatra. This is a black tea with an intense, but slightly sweet, flavor. It is grown in the Indonesian island of the same name.

**Blue tea**

This is the name sometimes given to semi-fermented teas, also called Oolong. Instead of completing the oxidation, the fermentation is stopped mid-process—usually after about two hours. The result is a tea halfway between green and black. It has a balanced flavor with a combination of the characteristics of green and black teas, and is very popular in Taiwan. The caffeine content depends on when the fermentation is interrupted and can vary from 10 to 55 mg per cup.

**Yellow tea**

The leaves of this tea are left to mature rather than ferment. These are varieties that are difficult to find commercially. Yellow tea takes its name from the color of the infusion it produces. It has a singular and defined taste that can be slightly bitter. Its fresh scent leaves the mouth clean and dry. Its flavor—somewhere between sweet and bitter—lingers on the tip of the tongue after drinking it.

Chun Shan Yin Chin is considered the best and most valuable yellow tea. Mao-chien and Huang Da Cha are other popular varieties.

**Red tea**

There is some confusion about what is popularly known as “red tea.” The Chinese give this name to Pu-erh, a variety of green tea that only grows in the Yunnan region and is fermented to darken it. This “tea of the Emperor,” so-called because it originally was reserved only for the highest offices of power, is frequently used in diets today because of its “fat-eliminating” qualities.

Sometimes “red tea” is used to refer to Rooibos, a South African plant with a sweet taste and invigorating and healing properties, which belongs to a botanical family unrelated to tea.

**White tea**

White tea is grown in many parts of China. It is lightly fermented and gives a very lightly colored infusion. In some plants, the leaf appears to have a white fuzz. The buds are harvested just two days of the year, in spring, and are picked by hand. It takes approximately 80,000 buds to produce only 250 grams of tea; this is why the price is so high.

The legend of the white tea

Popular tradition tells that in ancient China, this type of tea was harvested exclusively by maidens with gold scissors, and only the emperor had the right to taste it. The location of the sacred gardens was itself a mystery, and those few who discovered it paid with their lives. Pai Hao Yin Chin is a fairytale about this white tea.

In Fujian, there was once a drought so severe that nothing could be harvested for many seasons. Then a plague ravaged the country and many people died. The situation got worse and worse and the elders recommended they go search for a sacred plant that grew beside the well of a dragon, in a nearby mountain. The juice of this plant, they said, would bring back the land’s prosperity and cure the sick.

Many brave young people from Fujian went to the mountains in search of this sacred plant, but none of them returned, since the well was guarded by a fierce black dragon. Two brothers and their sister decided to go on the search. The oldest was the first to go, but he did not return. The second departed and suffered the same fate. Finally, the younger sister decided to go in search of her brothers and the plant. When she got there, she found that the dragon had turned the men to stone. Using her wits, she managed to steal the plant and kill the dragon with an arrow. With a few drops of the sacred plants, she brought the men back to life and they returned to the town and planted the seeds. The land became fertile once more and the sick were healed.

From that day on, all of the plants in Fujian, a province at an altitude of 6000 meters, were of white tea, which is grown there to this day.

White tea has a much softer taste and scent than the other teas, and it contains the least amount of theine: about 1 mg per cup. It is highly valued for its therapeutic properties since its antioxidant power is triple that of green tea. The most well-known varieties are Shou mei, Pai hao Yin chin, and Pai mu tan.

**Aromatic teas**

Normally these are made from lower-quality leaves. In western shops, they are most often mixed based on black tea, although there are some classics made with green tea like that jasmine—highly valued in China—or Japanese lime.

Tea gourmets always prefer the pure varieties, but if they are to consume aromatic tea, they opt for flower accents.

The fragrance of the flowers is incorporated into the leaves during processing.

It is essential to achieve the right balance between tea and flowers so the fragrance does not cover the natural flavor of the tea. According to experts, the flower should make up about 30 percent of the taste and the tea should be the other 70 percent. In and of itself, the type of flower depends on the type of tea. Teas with a stronger flavor allow for the incorporation of more concentrated fragrances.

The flowers most commonly used are jasmine, rose, lychee, and lotus.","Tea Colors - Lelow Online **Tea colors**

The botanical name for tea is Camellia sinensis, which comes from the family Camellia. This is the Chinese variety; in the northeast of India, a second variety known as Camellia assamica was discovered in the nineteenth century. The tea bush has leaves with finely serrated edges, with numerous oil glands. The flowers are white and have a delicate fragrance.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Tea Colours](https://preview.redd.it/zvwhoq8lnot81.jpg?width=575&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23d10cc2169048185ae3ae7151d054fe8ebe6dbf)

The cultivation of tea requires a warm, humid climate, and cultivation at higher altitudes is considered to produce tea of superior quality, although factors such as the climate, soil, method of harvest, and processing also affect the tea quality.

The majority of teas are made from young leaves. When the bush reaches the necessary maturity, leaves are picked by hand. For the highest quality teas, only the top three newest leaves are picked.

After harvesting comes to the drying process. The leaves are spread out and left to wilt until they are very malleable and can be rolled without breaking. During this process is when the leaves release the substances that give them their characteristic color and smell.

**The giant forest**

In 1939, in the province of Yunnan in the southeast of China, a huge swath of wild tea trees were discovered. Some were more than 98 feet (30 meters) high with trunks 3 feet (a meter) in diameter. Their age is estimated to be around 1,700 years old.

**Modern and classic teas**

The custom of delicately flavored teas has been around for many years; however, fruity teas are a more recent trend and are often closer to an herbal infusion. The ideal choice is always a tea with a truly natural aroma and essence, such as those shown on these pages.

**Green tea**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ziztcyl2lot81.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=928c2ab6e6628712a339d45a7e97b552e1cb17fa

[Green tea](https://lelow.online/product/darjeeling-green-tea-100-grams/) is made by drying the leaves completely to avoid fermentation. It is the most common tea consumed in China and Japan. Along with white tea, it has the most proven therapeutic properties.

Green tea tends to have a more delicate and herbal aroma. It has very little theine or caffeine; depending on the variety, the quantity may be between 8 and 16 mg per cup. By comparison, a cup of espresso can easily have more than 200 mg of caffeine. Here are some of the most highly regarded varieties:

• Bancha. Alongside Sencha, although of lesser quality, it is the most common tea in Japan. Very low in theine.

• Genmaicha. Green tea with toasted rice; is frequently drunk with meals by the Japanese.

• Gunpowder. A Chinese tea with a strong flavor, which also appeals to fans of black tea. Often in the form of leaves compressed into a small ball.

• Kokeicha. Three-year tea; is very valued in Japan. It is made by toasting very fine twigs four times. Then the twigs are pulverized and pressed into fine needles.

• Kukicha. Made up of the stems of tea leaves, it makes a yellowish infusion with a distinctive flavor and very little theine.

• Lung Ching. This tea is the lung ching (“dragonwell”). It comes from the lake region of Hangzho, China. It is celebrated for its emerald color and sweet taste.

• Matcha. Powdered green tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony; yields a rich, astringent, jade-colored infusion.

• Sencha. A Japanese classic. Also available in a decaffeinated version.

Mu Tea. The so-called mu tea does not contain tea leaves; it is actually a unique mixture of sixteen plants and spices, revived in the last few decades from an ancient oriental tradition. It has a very particular taste and is wonderful for digestion. 

**Black tea**

&amp;#x200B;

[Black Tea](https://preview.redd.it/vy454dmjlot81.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5581839253ee765fe8c6de09adc881dfc2b9a1f)

[Black tea](http://lelow.online/black-tea/) is obtained through an oxidation process. Freshly harvested leaves are left in humid rooms so they ferment. This treatment lasts between three and five hours depending on the variety, which gives the tea its characteristic dark green or black color.

Black tea has a strong flavor—closer to coffee—and can be combined with milk. It has a higher quantity of caffeine than green tea has. Each cup contains between 25 and 100 mg, depending on the degree of fermentation.

Among the most popular varieties of black tea are:

• [Assam](https://lelow.online/product/halmari-tea-assam-ctc-buy-online-best-quality/). A full-bodied tea with a warm brown color. The Camellia assamica—a different plant than Sinensis—is grown in the northeast region of India.

• Ceilan. The ancient name for Sri Lanka is given to this delicate and aromatic black tea. It is commonly sold in bags.

• Darjeeling. Called “the champagne of teas” for its delicate fragrance and flavor. It is grown on the slopes of the Indian Himalayas. It is also sold decaffeinated.

• Earl Grey. Classic British mix of black tea with bergamot. It is one of the most commonly purchased bagged teas.

**Leaves from the sky**

The Darjeeling valley is found in the northeast region of India, on the border with Nepal. Eighty-seven tea plantations in this region have a 125-year history. The plant is grown at elevations between 1,970 and 7,050 feet (600 and 2,150 meters), on steep mountainsides that drain heavy monsoon rains.

The tea that grows in this region is of unmatched quality, a bundle of it falling somewhere between sweet grapes and ripe peaches.

“An after-dinner conversation without tea disturbs the order of the universe.” - RUDYARD KIPLING

[Tea](https://lelow.online/product/giddapahar-darjeeling-first-flush-tea/) is a legendary drink that continues to gain fans around the world. In fact, its popularity has grown so much in the last two thousand years that today the only beverage consumed more is water.

**Lu Tung, “Song of Tea”**

1. The first cup moistens my lips and throat. 
2. The second cup breaks my loneliness. 
3. The third cup searches my barren entrail, but to find therein some thousand volumes of odd ideographs.
4. The fourth cup raises slight perspiration; all the wrongs of life pass out through my pores.
5. At the fifth cup, I am purified.
6. The sixth cup calls me to the realms of immortals.
7. The seventh cup–ah, but I could take no more!

I only feel the breath of the cool wind that raises in my sleeves.

Where is Paradise? Let me ride on this sweet breeze and waft away thither.

Someone \[Okakura Kakuzō\] said that tea “has not the arrogance of wine, the self-consciousness of coffee, nor the simpering innocence of cocoa.”

Whether used in an infusion, a smoothie, or in cooking, the delicious and delicate flavor of this plant can surprise even the most demanding gourmet.

[Leaves of Bliss](https://preview.redd.it/p7rawr2azmt81.jpg?width=187&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91ba0d371f35cfc45b9fd6bd36183c13ff39e08a)

This treasure of health and flavor was zealously guarded by emperors for many centuries until intrepid merchants from Holland and Britain began to import it to the West.

There are many varieties of tea, defined by their origin and processing, but among all of them, green and white teas stand out for their prodigious health benefits. Their powerful antioxidant effects—and gentle stimulating properties—have been linked to the exceptional longevity of the populations in regions of China and Japan.

This book details all of these benefits and offers delicious recipes for tea lovers to enjoy new flavors in many forms: infusions, cocktails, ice creams, and sauces based on tea.

But just as the universe of Camellia sinensis—its botanical name—is immensely rich and varied, in this book we will also see other fascinating aspects of tea culture: the Japanese tea ceremony, a selection of stories for teatime, and even tea leaf readings.

4. The fourth cup raises slight perspiration; all the wrongs of life pass out through my pores.
5. At the fifth cup, I am purified.
6. The sixth cup calls me to the realms of immortals.
7. The seventh cup–ah, but I could take no more!

I only feel the breath of the cool wind that raises in my sleeves.

Where is Paradise? Let me ride on this sweet breeze and waft away thither.

Someone \[Okakura Kakuzō\] said that tea “has not the arrogance of wine, the self-consciousness of coffee, nor the simpering innocence of cocoa.”

Whether used in an infusion, a smoothie, or in cooking, the delicious and delicate flavor of this plant can surprise even the most demanding gourmet.

This treasure of health and flavor was zealously guarded by emperors for many centuries until intrepid merchants from Holland and Britain began to import it to the West.

There are many varieties of tea, defined by their origin and processing, but among all of them, green and white teas stand out for their prodigious health benefits. Their powerful antioxidant effects—and gentle stimulating properties—have been linked to the exceptional longevity of the populations in regions of China and Japan.

The history of tea,"# The history of tea

**A legendary origin**

The first documents that mention [***tea***](https://lelow.online/product/darjeeling-green-tea-100-grams/) date back to the period between the seventh and sixth centuries BC. The inhabitants of ancient China in this period sang of the excellence of Tu, the name given to the group of plants which we now know as tea. This is the official origin, although if we give credit to popular legend, tea has been around since approximately the year 2700 BC. 

Between the years 206 BC and 221 AD, during the Han dynasty, improved methods of gathering and preparing tea leaves made tea a popular beverage of the royal family. Its prestige among the nobility grew, reaching its peak in the period of the Three Kingdoms (221–277 AD), when tea served as a substitute for wine at the court’s banquets.

**Emperor Chen Nung**

The French writer Maxence Fermine describes, in his novel Opium, the discovery of tea in China: “One day, more than four thousand years ago, the emperor Chen Nung was traveling with his guard through a distant region of his great country. As the journey was long and tiring, he ordered them to let him stop to rest in the shade of some trees to protect them from the sun. 

The convoy stopped and the emperor sat cross-legged under an unknown bush. Immediately, he asked for a bowl of boiling water, as he was thirsty and it was the best remedy he knew to quench his thirst. His servants hurried to bring it to him. At that moment, a leaf fell into the emperor’s bowl. Chen Nung drank the water without notice, and when he did a sweet yet bitter aroma filled his throat. Intrigued, he looked into the bowl and found the leaf that gave this fascinating scent and flavor. And thus tea was born.”

 The general population would wait another five centuries before experiencing the goodness of this virtuous plant, since it wasn’t until the Tang dynasty, from 618 to 907 AD, that tea became the national beverage of China. Proof of this is that a philosopher of the time, Lu Yu, wrote the first account of its history, cultivation, and preparation in 780 AD: the Cha-Ching.”

Tea’s reputation reached every corner of China, thanks to caravans of merchants that crisscrossed the country. In 705 AD, Camellia sinensis crossed borders for the first time and was introduced in Japan by a monk named Dengyo Daishi. During this same time period, tea arrived in Tibet and was a great success. There they boiled tablets of pressed tea and then mixed it with butter and salt. It wasn’t until the start of the twentieth century that tea in the form of infusion became popular there, although there are still many Tibetans that prefer the traditional preparation.

**Tibetan style tea**

In his memoir, Seven Years in Tibet, mountain climber Heinrich Harrer (played in the movie by Brad Pitt) describes the local custom of drinking tea mixed with yak lard, a combination that he found horrifying. The author commented that some Tibetans claimed to drink more than a hundred cups a day.

**Beyond China**

Tea had begun to cross borders at the beginning of the ninth century when the first shipments arrived by boat to Korea and Japan. There, a Buddhist monk called Yesai published the first Japanese book on tea in 1191. Both countries began to cultivate tea in the humid, mountainous regions, and their inhabitants soon learned of the therapeutic properties of the infusion. Zen monks incorporated tea in their routines in the temple, in combination with meditation that lasted all day.

Regarding the union between Buddhism and tea, the legend tells that an Indian prince named Drama had decided to devote his life to prayer. Abandoning his home, he began a pilgrimage toward China and Japan. Exhausted from the hard days of journeying, he succumbed to a deep sleep along the banks of a river and slept for a long time. 

Upon waking, he felt horrified by his laziness and meted himself a severe punishment so as not to succumb to sleep again: he cut off his eyelids and buried them in the place where he had slept. Many years later, returning to his home, he passed that same place and discovered that a strange bush was growing where he had buried the eyelids. The monk chewed a few leaves and realized that they helped keep the mind awake. Since then, the Zen monks have always cultivated tea in the monastery gardens.

**From “cha” to “tea”**

The names given for the word “tea” are very similar throughout Asia: in Japan, it’s called cha, in Russia caj, in India tschaj and in China, ch’a. Some linguists maintain that it’s possible all these names come from the word for “vitality” in Chinese, chi.

In the Fukien province of China, the Dutch learned the word tay, which means “tea” in the local dialect, and this sound was introduced to Europe. In fact, in Ireland and England, it was pronounced tay until the start of the eighteenth century, after which the word was derived to tee and then tea—as we know it today.

In many European languages, the same word is used as a generic term for herbal teas or an infusion of herbs.

Apart from making the most of tea’s curative properties, the Japanese nobles also began to include tea in their social meetings. Thus was born the Cha no yu, the tea ceremony, a delicate and demanding ritual lasting several hours, for which the hosts would have expensive and precious utensils.

**Tea arrives in the West**

The first record of the existence of tea in the West dates to the year 851 AD. It was written by an Arab merchant named Suleiman in his book Relations in China and India, where he defined it as “an aromatic herb with a bitter taste that is drunk with boiled water in the East.”

Apparently, westerners did not hear about this infusion again until 1529, when the Venetian Giambattista Ramusio wrote in his book Navigazione e Viaggi about the existence of a plant in the East that “calms pain of gout and also guarantees good stomach function.” Jesuit missionaries that visited China and Japan in the sixteenth century also spoke of a plant with a sweet taste that the natives called chai.

**The East India Company**

In the seventeenth century, the European powers competed to claim the new markets in Asia. During this process, the Dutch East India Company brought the first shipment of tea to Europe in 1606. Later, the ships of the English East India Company achieved a monopoly on tea and began to distribute it in France, Germany, and Portugal as well as England. In 1657, the first teahouse opened in London, and financial transactions involving the plant took place on its upper floors. But tea became popular in England a few years later, when King Charles II married Catalina de Berganza, a great fan of the beverage.

The Portuguese princess brought with her dowry the port of Bombay, one of the most important hubs of maritime commerce between Asia and Europe, which became key in the tea trade between the two continents. The infusion began to be served in the court and, during the following century, became the most popular beverage in England, winning over even beer and gin.

In 1834, the East India Company lost its monopoly on tea after the implementation of a British governmental resolution. With free competition between companies, the speed of the ships became more important, so large ships gave way to small, lightships called clippers. This produced true competition to be the first to arrive in port and be able to sell at the best price, resulting in all kinds of incidents and adventures on the high seas, as the typical passage took about a hundred days.

The custom of adding milk to tea—so deeply entrenched in England today—was introduced by the Dutch in the early seventeenth century and then spread to France and England. The Japanese and Chinese never add milk to tea because they believe it ruins the flavor, original color, and aroma of the infusion.

Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, tea was drunk at any time of day. The creation of the British afternoon tea—at five o’clock—is attributed to the Duchess of Bedford, who after drinking it in the afternoon with a snack found it so delicious she instituted the ritual with all her friends.

**The spread of tea**

In 1810 the Chinese began to cultivate tea on the island of Formosa, in modern-day Taiwan. A decade later in Assam, in the northeastern region of India, Robert Bruce and his brother discovered vast thickets of tea growing naturally and established the tea industry in the then-British colony, including the Darjeeling region.

In other parts of the world, tea arrived under more difficult circumstances. In Ceylan, modern-day Sri Lanka, the cultivation of tea began in earnest after a plague affecting coffee trees devastated all the plantations on the island—at that time it was the second-largest producer of coffee in the world.

In each country, tea has been introduced differently, with many local variations. The Maghrebis, for example, inherited tea from the English and their national drink is mint tea. It is served in a glass with a lot of sugar and accompanied by honey cakes. Proper etiquette dictates that the host should drink at least three glasses of tea, with the last one being stronger than the previous.

In 1900, with the inauguration of the Trans-Siberian railroad, tea was no longer transported by camel from Peking to Russia. And four years later, Richard Blechyden presented a refreshing invention at the St. Louis World’s Fair: iced tea.","The history of tea # The history of tea

Shan Lin Xi Winter Sprout 2022 Harvest - bad batch?,"Has anyone tried the the 2022 harvest of the tea in the title from Song Tea [(this one)](https://songtea.com/collections/oolong-tea/products/slx-winter-sprout?variant=12303454863448)?

I saw it recommended super highly in the subreddit, so I got it, and that was a few months ago when it was the 2021 harvest. It was truly awesome, a great tea I was willing to shell out again for. By the time I went to repurchase, it was sold out and then shortly after that the 2022 harvest popped up.

But it tastes completely different, to me. I don't get the cotton candy/sugary notes at all like with the 2021.

Super chocolatey Chinese black on a budget?,"My friend gave me an Adagio sampler of Chinese black teas last Christmas, and it includes [this Keemun](https://www.adagio.com/black/keemun_rhapsody.html) which is just fantastic. I'm not good at describing taste, but it has a really intense dark chocolate flavor that sticks around in your mouth for ever (maybe kind of malty or smoky also?), and is great gong fu'ed or western brewed. Unfortunately it's also out of my budget :( So I'm seeing if I can find another Chinese black with a similar intense dark chocolate taste but ideally under 15 cents a gram.

Any suggestions? The Fujian ""Golden Spring"" black in the Adagio sampler also had the right flavor, just not quite as strong. Meanwhile the Adagio Yunnan dianhong was too mild and sweet (maybe you could call it more of a milk chocolate than a dark chocolate, I want to get punched in the face like a Lindt 70% cacao bar). Should I just try a Fujian black from Yunnan Sourcing? Or do you have other suggestions for well-priced Chinese blacks with a strong chocolatey flavor?","Super chocolatey Chinese black on a budget?

Best decaf loose leaf online?,"Hello again. So today I went to Walmart and picked up some loose leaf infusers but found no good loose leaf tea. Now I would like to purchase some online that will meet a few requirements preferably. 

1. Little to no caffiene 
2. Loose leaf
3. Not expensive (25 dollars for a few ounces)

I'm not in the best spot financially but love tea and want to expand my knowledge of tea. So far I've mostly just ever had herbal from brands like celestial, stash, and Bigelow. I have found that some of these herbal teas are far too weak in flavor for me and end up just being slightly altered water. However some flavors such as Bengal Spice, or peppermint, have been absolutely wonderful when mixed into a sort of latte with milk and honey. I also really loved the decaf chai black tea from Bigelow. I am putting in an order for some earl grey and some English breakfast decaf from TheTeaKitchen and GoodlifeTea. Anything negative to say about these brands? Any brands I probably shouldn't buy from and brands I most definitely should buy from?
Thank you and I'm sorry if this came off as obnoxious or rude in any way, just not doing too hot on money and also my anxiety gets worse with caffiene. 

Oh, and yes I am aware that shopping for good loose leaf at Walmart probably wasn't the wisest move, thank you :)","Best decaf loose leaf online? Hello again.

Tea tasted better in Florida?,"Hello! I am a casual tea drinker in need of some assistance. For spring break, I travelled down to Florida to enjoy some sun. In the town I was staying at was a lovely tea and spice shop. I purchased some strawberry green tea to enjoy on my trip and to take home. Because I didn't expect to buy loose leaf tea during my vacation, I didn't bring my strainer and made due with my friend's coffee filters instead. It was the best green tea I've tasted in years. 

When I returned from my trip, I decided to brew another cup, this time with my kettle and strainer, instead of a microwave and coffee filter. Instead of the flavorful tea I was used to, it was bland. 

Was it my kettle? My strainer? They steeped for the same amount of time as it did in Florida. The bag for the tea is resealable so freshness shouldn't a problem. This is really good tea and I'm wondering how I've managed to bungle it so badly considering how good it was on break.","Tea tasted better in Florida? Hello!

tea recs and diy tea bag making,"Hi all,

I'm a tea newb in the sense I don't know much outside loose leaf black teas (started with chai, but I diversified to some other stuff). Outside that I don't know anything about anything. I tried a somewhat expensive bagged green tea from hmart for the first time and got a headache drinking it because it was so bad. I've had really good green tea at a japanese tea garden which I loved tho so I know its just some low quality side effect or smt.

Coming to my main questions (no need to answer all, just be like { 2) &lt;followed by your answer&gt; } ), I would like tea recs and ingredient suggestions for the following:

1) a green tea, ive had hojicha, matcha, genmaicha which i liked (have heard of longqing, gyokuro, never had though) 

2) what tea has the highest and/or most diverse antioxidants?

3) is Pu er really that good and what is butterfly pea tea, are these worth getting, are they super healthy or what?

4) if I want to just diy something and combine green tea, herbal tea, and something with a hint of spice into a coffee filter tea bag, what ingredients could I combine to create such a tea profile?

&amp;#x200B;

I know these are a lot of questions. I'm trying to do my own research but there is a lot of 'fake' info online and I would like to hope that the people here have more insight than other internet goons. I am also reading the subreddit here for info so if you have links to check or key words to tell me instead of explaining yourself, that's also appreciated!

Low sugar or sugar free sweeteners for cold brewing?,"Lately, I've been trying to get into tea drinking in order to quit soda.

Thompson's Scottish Blend,"Is anyone familiar with this black tea? It's tailored ""for softer water"". I bought it on a whim on Amazon, and it's the best dang tea I have ever tasted! It's got a thick, rich flavor and although I'm a ravenous coffee drinker, at the moment I'm shifting my drink of choice to tea.  I find that a nice, strong flavor like this is ""filling"",  almost like a small meal!

Anyway, I'm curious what it is about this blend that makes it so special and tasty. I'm hoping to find something similar that is available in Canada, as this ships from the UK which is expensive. I have to use my bag of it sparingly. I'm hoping to find something similar either in the supermarkets, or in the specialty tea places here in Vancouver.

Does anyone have any insights on this blend? Thanks in advance!","Thompson's Scottish Blend Is anyone familiar with this black tea? It's tailored ""for softer water"".

Best Mid-range Matcha for lattes/stand alone?,"As the title says! I’m looking for a good matcha brand that is all-around flavorful.

The Tea Journey Starts Today - Help!,"Sooo, about a few days ago, I decided I wanted to stop drinking soda. My face acne is getting worse and that aside, it’s rotting my teeth. I have REALLY good teeth, but if I keep drinking soda, I could gain major cavities. And my soda intake is BAD, I drink multiple sodas a day, and my room is literally filled to the brim with empty cans. However, that was days ago, now I’m drinking water and haven’t touched soda in, like, 2 days. Now, I probably won’t quit soda forever, but I want to definitely lower my intake and daily consumption, cutting it down to maybe one soda a week. And I feel tea could probably fill that role. 

Just like most users who are asking about tea for the first time, I’m SUPER inexperienced. I’ve never brewed or brought tea that wasn’t either Snapple or Gold Peak. I don’t even drink tea period, wasn’t my forte. However, i think I want to make the switch if it’ll be better than soda, since I know I can’t keep drinking water forever, I’ll eventually go cold Turkey sooner or later, and the cravings are sort of coming back. 

The question is… where do I start? I’m a student in HS, so having a cup every day would be nice. I don’t know if I’ll buy tea online unless I get really invested. There is a Trader Joe’s near me and I read somewhere on the subreddit that TJ has good tea selections. Is brewing it hard, how do you get over the bitterness and not get tempted to put sugar, cream or milk in it? Should I go for honest teas in the meantime until I find good “brewed” teas?

Brewing Oolong Tea Gong Fu Style,"Hi, I am new to tea and I recently purchased some loose leaf Oolong Tea off a website called Mei Leaf and I tried it out just to be disappointed. The taste was so one-dimensional. It tasted like dirt, actual dirt, no analogy intended. I brewed it for about 30 seconds in 212 degrees Fahrenheit and used around 11-12 grams for 200-240mL of water. I did not rinse it.

Did I do something wrong? Everytime I read a review or watch some Youtuber who is into this way of making tea, they go on AND on about the flavors of sweetness, fruitiness, creaminess, nutty, mineral etc.  Is tea really that flavorful, am I missing something? 

Thanks.","Brewing Oolong Tea Gong Fu Style Hi, I am new to tea and I recently purchased some loose leaf Oolong Tea off a website called Mei Leaf and I tried it out just to be disappointed.

"New to matcha, seeking advice about ratios!","Hi all,

I've jumped on the matcha train! After doing my research, I've decided to ditch coffee so I can reap all of the benefits of matcha; I am very excited!

I just received my first packed of Encha Ceremonial Grade and do, however, have a few questions.

I am used to making an cold latte in the morning in a 18oz cup. This used 2 shots of espresso, followed by filling the rest of the cup up with milk. I'd say 16oz milk.

I am wanting to replace the espresso with matcha powder, therefore, I am wondering the proportions.

I read on the Encha site to mix 1 tsp of matcha powder with 2oz of water, followed by 5-6oz of milk.

Because I still want to consume generally the same amount of milk in the morning, I am wondering if I should do 2 tsp of matcha powder with 2oz of water, followed by 16oz of milk? Or should I do 2 tsp of matcha powder with 4oz of water, followed by 14oz of milk?

Side question, I am also wondering why Encha suggests to mix the matcha powder with water first, prior to filling the cup up and mixing with milk?

Thank you so much in advance! I look forward to hearing from you!","New to matcha, seeking advice about ratios! Hi all,

"Rooibos, Green Tea, and Green Rooibos","I'm attempting (for the millionth time) to end my coffee addiction by switching to tea.

Gongfu on the go (ie hiking) - whats the best solution for boiling hot water? Do actively heated ones exist?,"Hey there teafolk,

TL;DR: whats a good way to keep/obtain boiling water for fresh brewed tea during a hike?

This spring I'd like to have some nature outings and take time while I'm out to have a mini tea-picnic in serene settings. There are some wonderful travel gongfu sets out there these days, but I'm wondering if there's anything out there that can really keep a container of near-boiling water for a few hours.

Lets say I boil water at home, put it in a pre-warmed vessel, travel 0.5-1.5 hours, hike for an hour, and then want to make a pu-erh to share with my friend(s) (so at least 500-700ml). 

In a typical thermos I'm skeptical that the water will remain close enough to boiling to be useful, though perhaps for a green or oolong, maybe black if the trip is on the shorter side. A video demonstration from Zojirushi shows about 40 degrees drop from boiling in 6 hours, so if we can assume linear drop, that means -20 degrees after 3hr, bringing it to about green/oolong territory

There exist car-lighter powered boilers, but I often won't be traveling in a car. [Another redditor explained why it's unlikely a USB powered kettle would exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/kp4v64/any_good_portable_electric_kettles_i_could_buy_to/ghv4gyo/) but this also assumes you're boiling water from scratch, I think it wouldn't be so bad if you were using fairly hot water like in the above scenario and using a heating element to slow the temperature drop...

Which brought me to the existence of temperature controlled travel mugs, but from what I can see these are also almost all car-powered, though a few battery powered ones are out there but they mostly top out around 140F.

Lastly there's the camping approach, but almost any fuel stove and pot to boil water will be bigger than the entire travel gongfu set, so unless I was actually camping I think this would be untenable for an enjoyable hike.

Anyone have any other ideas? Have I unfairly discounted one of the above approaches? Or does anyone have experience trying this? Maybe the tried and true thermos is ""good enough""... I know I can always lower my expectations, but if it's possible, I'd love to make it happen.","Gongfu on the go (ie hiking) - whats the best solution for boiling hot water?

"Recommendations for dishwasher safe, 2ish-cup tea infuser set up?","The wiki says, “Assuming you are interested in loose leaf tea, the most basic setup for a beginner would be a cup and strainer or infuser (avoid small or novelty infusers).”

Thoughts on what’s a good tea infuser/what do you all use?

I currently use a tea ball, but it has a little plastic bit that isn’t dishwasher safe and it’s tiring needing to hand wash it all the time. Also little leafy pieces come out of the teaball often, as it’s getting looser. Preferred qualities:
-	Dishwasher safe
-	Can hold up to 2 cups of tea
-	Strainer doesn’t let out little leafy bits
-	Budget $30-$40

At Chinese tea places in my hometown, Ive used a little narrow glass thing that I’ve enjoyed, but I’m not sure what that’s called and/or if those are dishwasher safe.

Thoughts? If no recommendations, am still curious about different tea set-ups that are out there. Thank you for sharing!","Recommendations for dishwasher safe, 2ish-cup tea infuser set up?

Please suggest a vendor for premium bagged black tea,"Hi all,

I drink loose leaf tea almost exclusively, but bagged tea is very convenient for travel. Living in Switzerland I have found a few good brands (Sirocco, Länggasstee) that offer tea pyramids with good loose leaf tea in them, but I end up paying something like 0,60-0,80CHF (US$ 0.70-0.90) per bag that way.

In the US in the past I had bought Numi teabags in bulk pack (100 ct) which is currently about $0.35/bag. I never thought Mighty Leaf justified its price premium over Numi, FWIW.

Filling my own tea pouches would somewhat cancel the convenience of bagged tea for travel, so I am definitely looking for prepackaged bagged / pyramided teas.

Any recommendations for bagged high quality black teas (nothing exotic, it could be an ""English Breakfast"" or a ""Yunnan Golden Special"" or something like just a decent Assam, Qimen, Darjeeling, etc)? I am currently looking at Tealyra. I've ordered loose leaf tea from them in the past with mostly  positive results. I realize they aren't viewed as a really excellent / expert provider, but I'm not looking for niche teas, just pretty darned good bagged tea - ie, better quality than Numi but less than the $.60/bag I am paying in Switzerland :) I've never ordered from Adagio but they're pretty pricey for bagged tea...

All ears and open to all opinions / abuse / insults hehe :)","Please suggest a vendor for premium bagged black tea Hi all,

Deodorizing Tea,"Just recently was gifted some spice containers from someone moving out of my apt -- figured they would be an improvement over the resealable bags I got my tea in (the seal on some of the bags was breaking).   


Gave the containers a thorough wash, and afterwards they had no smell whatsoever. 

2 Days later I open my Dongfang Meiren and all I could smell was onion powder (Dongfang Meiren instant noodles anyone?).

But I would still prefer to get my Dongfang Meiren, Tie Guan Yin, Da Hong Pao, and Dragonwell back to their original scent.

What’s your go to method for brewing large quantities of tea?,"I love drinking tea throughout the day but that’s not really the setting for gong fu, can’t be pouring tiny little cups all day. I know a lot of people brew grandpa style but I find it quite annoying to keep heating and pouring more water in the cup as I drink, since I always need to wait for the water to get hot. 

Ideally, I’d want to have a big pot full of tea to drink as I go. Unfortunately every time I’ve tried to upsize my green tea cup to a pot, I find that it gets very bitter. Of course I take the leaves out after brewing time but as it cools in the pot, the tea still gets bitter. 

I’ve also tired to make a big pot of oolong but it just didn’t have the flavour or texture it does gong fu style. 

So I’m asking you! How do you like to make lots of tea? Do you have an exciting secret method? Or do you just not drink green tea when you want a lot of tea? I do like to cold brew over night but we’re having a bit of a winter moment where I live and I’d like my tea to be hot.","What’s your go to method for brewing large quantities of tea?

Ideally, I’d want to have a big pot full of tea to drink as I go. Unfortunately every time I’ve tried to upsize my green tea cup to a pot, I find that it gets very bitter. Of course I take the leaves out after brewing time but as it cools in the pot, the tea still gets bitter. 

I’ve also tired to make a big pot of oolong but it just didn’t have the flavour or texture it does gong fu style. 

So I’m asking you! How do you like to make lots of tea? Do you have an exciting secret method? Or do you just not drink green tea when you want a lot of tea? I do like to cold brew over night but we’re having a bit of a winter moment where I live and I’d like my tea to be hot.",tea,go method brewing large quantity tea love drinking tea throughout day really set gong fu pour tiny little cup day know lot people brew grandpa style find quite annoy keep heating pour water cup drink since always need wait water get hot ideally want big pot full tea drink go unfortunately every time try upsize green tea cup pot find get bitter course take leaf brewing time cool pot tea still get bitter also tire make big pot oolong flavour texture gong fu style ask like make lot tea excite secret method drink green tea want lot tea like cold brew night bit winter moment live like tea hot,1053,221

Where to start?,"I really wanna start drinking tea. I don't have the best experience with it let's say, let me explain.

So I wanted to start drinking tea/black coffee like a year ago, and introduced the both of them gradually to my diet. I didn't like black coffee at first but over time, I learned to love it (it tastes great to me now). For tea however, I haven't introduced it to the same extent, probably because my parents don't drink them = don't buy em.

I drank ginger tea as a child and that was somewhat traumatic as a kid. Started chamomile tea a year ago (thinking I'd like it) but it only tasted like.... flowers? I onlt had like 5 cups. I've pretty much only had like 8 cups of hot tea throughout my life, which probably impacted its taste for me.

I want to drink more of it and get its acquired taste, just like I had with coffee. Don't know where to start though. I'm thinking green tea is a safe start but then again my knowledge about this all is limited. Any help is appreciated, thank you!","Where to start? I really wanna start drinking tea.

Types of Tea Pots,"Hi! I enjoy tea and am looking at investing in a teapot and a kettle to make the experience a bit nicer. However, what are the various types of teapots and the benefits of each?

What kind of teapot(s) do you use and why? And any ideas where I can get good ones that aren't made in China? I try to buy things made elsewhere when possible (not politically motivated, fyi, but a long story).

Avocado Seed Tea,"https://imgur.com/Z6TuZC2

First time buying from an Ottawa tea company that makes tea from avocado pits that would normally be discarded by local restaurants. The money apparently goes towards meeting sustainable development goals set by the UN. The unflavoured base tea tastes a bit like genmatcha/roasted rice but not as strong and maybe a bit fruity. Looking forward to trying the other blends - they seem cocktail-y.

Black Tea Recommendations,"Just recently got into tea -- I've tried a decent spectrum of tea but I am still searching for what teas I should have in my daily set. Wondering if people could recommend some to try, particularly black teas, as I feel that's the one tea I am underrating the most. 

Teas tried before:

Black: Smoked Lapsang Souchong (absolutely loved it), Keemun (not really a fan, have tried medium and high quality, it's doable with milk).
Oolongs (likely my favourite type): Da Hong Pao (loved &amp; have a ton), Rou Gui (loved), Dongfang Meiren, Tie Guan Yin, and Pheonix Oolong (all three liked quite a bit). 
White: Silver Needle (decent, oddly preferred lower quality than high due to astringency). 
Green: Dragon Well (decent, good at room temp with rock sugar), Organic Green (meh). 
Pu'er: Golden Pu'er (really liked, even with the fishy smell).

Not sure if that helps for a flavour profiling, but I seem set for Oolongs, and I guess I don't really like Green or White (though will keep some on hand for the lightness), and I will likely need to pick up a decent Pu'er when I get an YiXing tea pot. But black tea really seems to be the tea that I likely would like but am short on.","Black Tea Recommendations Just recently got into tea -- I've tried a decent spectrum of tea but I am still searching for what teas I should have in my daily set.

Smelling Empty Wine Glasses,"I know this isn’t generally a practice a lot of wine drinkers include in their tasting, but I have been doing it a lot lately to my enjoyment and was wondering if it’s something anyone else does or if there is anything to it. I’m relatively new to wine but I’ve been drinking it in - literally and intellectually - a lot in the past few months, and I’ve noticed that the aroma of different wines left at the bottom of the empty glass are not unpleasant, and are very different from each other and the wines that used fill the glasses. I can pick out distinct notes, and to my nose, they can broaden the wine’s flavor profile. They can even sometimes show if a winemaker was cutting corners by adding artificial flavors to a cheaper wine.

Why I even considered taking this practice semi-seriously: I also like drinking tea in the traditional Chinese style known as gongfu. A big part of enjoying your tea this way is smelling your empty cup (or gaiwan) after you have finished it. All of the antioxidants, oils, and flavor compounds are the most concentrated and fragrant when your cup is empty, and it produces a warmer, richer nose than any other way to smell tea, be it the wet leaves or the the drink itself. The name for this is bēi xiāng, and it is a fundamental part of tea tasting.

I haven’t found that wine drinkers often include this in the process of their own tasting and aside from cultural differences and practices from the east to the west, I suspect it’s because wine and tea are very different kinds of beverages, and wine oxidizes very quickly when there is a high surface area to volume ratio. That being said, the multitudes of flavor compounds are still there, only a minority of them oxidize straightaway, and the alcohol does the same evaporative legwork that a heated gaiwan does in concentrating the aroma. More importantly, in this novice’s opinion (who hardly has a grasp on any of the science behind this) the empty glass smells quite good, better than the actual wine smells in a few cases.

Let me know what you, think, and if I’m completely talking out of my ***, let me know why I’m wrong so we can all learn together :)","Smelling Empty Wine Glasses I know this isn’t generally a practice a lot of wine drinkers include in their tasting, but I have been doing it a lot lately to my enjoyment and was wondering if it’s something anyone else does or if there is anything to it.

Seattle : Floating Leaves Tea vs Seattle Best Tea (Jasmine),"Wondering what everyone’s opinion is on this: 

I have been buying tea from FLT, I really like to drink Jasmine on a daily basis and usually buy a pound at a time which quite honestly doesn’t last long. 

My husband told me that SBT has Jasmine at a better price so I went and bought a pound to try. 

FLT Jasmine doesn’t seem to be just Jasmine, to be honest feels like some sort of black tea is mixed in but I am not sure.. SBT tea is way lighter in flavor and color and the loose leaf tea has some Jasmine flowers in it. Both are very fragrant but SBT is definitely more delicate and aromatic. 

Does anyone know what the difference between different qualities of jasmine is? how I can judge better where to buy from? What is your experience with these two jasmines? Any favorite place to buy jasmine from? 

I like both but they are super different lol","Seattle : Floating Leaves Tea vs Seattle Best Tea (Jasmine) Wondering what everyone’s opinion is on this:

A coffee guys bright idea while getting into tea,"Hey, guys and gals!  


I'm a pretty passionate coffee guy, and have recently developed an interest in tea. I have been watching some resources on YouTube, Mei Leaf for the most part, and I have some ideas i would like to discuss with some people that know much more about tea than i do.   


So, after i had gotten my quality tea, i still wasnt happy about how the tea tasted. It was full of bitterness and left my tongue very dry, I'm assuming those are the tannins working their magic. I therefore troubleshooted my process and turned out im brewing with too much leaf for too long, and in one of those tea balls. I then watched Mei Leafs video where he showed off the \[Conniseur Tea Brewer\]([https://youtu.be/puldqGnW9P0?t=1521](https://youtu.be/puldqGnW9P0?t=1521)), and i thought ""My, oh my, that works a lot like some coffee brewers that are very popular, the \[Hario Switch\]([https://youtu.be/2sYSCqCkF6k?t=106](https://youtu.be/2sYSCqCkF6k?t=106)) (timelapse where you can see easily how it works), or the Clever Dripper. They are basically holders for a coffee filter with a valve at the bottom. You rinse your filter, put in your coffee and water and let it infuse french press style, and then you open the valve after the desired brew time to release the coffee through the paper filter and into the cup. I then thought to myself ""How is this different to what that tea brewer is doing?"", and that is where you guys come in.   


Would the Hario Switch be a viable tea brewer?   
Is filtering tea through a (pre rinsed) coffee filter a bad thing?   
Do you see any other problems using these brewers?   
Do you see any overlap between tea and coffee?  
Also, just for the heck of it, any fun tips for my tea journey?","A coffee guys bright idea while getting into tea Hey, guys and gals!

Black tea drinker trying to get into white tea (Questions),"Doing some experimentation here. I like the appeal of white tea being this more refined, special tea. Blacks are my usual go to and I don't really fancy the others. Greens just taste like grass. Oolong feels like watered down black tea and leaves me neither here nor there. 

So I'm giving white tea a try (Pai Mu Tan, since I didn't want to dive straight into breaking the bank on silver needle just yet), but I'm not sure if I got the wrong thing or if I'm brewing this wrong? The leaves/buds seem like any ol green tea, maybe a little less vibrant. I don't know if I even see any buds in there for that matter. There's nothing white about it, nor are there those hairs that I thought there would be. Are there even meant to be hairs in this type of white tea?

Brewing &amp; Taste - Used 1 tablespoon, brewed for 6 mins at 80 degrees. What I got was a light caramel-brown, nothing near white-ish. And the flavor was no different to an ooloong that had maybe been brewed for a minute less than normal (Earthy, is the only thing I am picking up). So, again, I'm not sure whats going on.

"Lost appetite for tea after COVID, anyone else with this experience?","Very sad :(

So for the last two years I was an absolute tea fiend. Like, to obsessive, unhealthy levels lmao. White/green/oolong/puerh/matcha/black you name it, loved it. Drank 5 cups a day, every time I went to the supermarket would walk through the tea aisle literally just to inhale the scent; would even frequently eat the leaves, wet or dry.

Anyway, all that to say tea was a huge part of my life, and I couldn't really imagine going without it. Then January this year, contacted covid. Was very mild fortunately. During that time was only drinking water/hydralyte. Never lost my sense of smell or taste at any point (which is what I was initially worried about)-- but ever since, the one lingering effect is that I have completely lost my appetite for tea. Would even go so far as to say the thought of tea almost repels me. This goes for every type of tea. And it's not like they smell any different than before, it's just I feel my brain flicked a switch and decided not to enjoy it any more. I think I've only drunk 2 cups since January and I didn't enjoy them much at all. They were some of my favorites too (milk oolong, sencha). 

It's just so strange to me, and honestly it makes me so sad. I hope one day I can once again enjoy tea like I used to. Had this happened to anyone else?","Lost appetite for tea after COVID, anyone else with this experience? Very sad :(

Is there anything specific I might do to make a better cup of green tea at home (without a gaiwan)?",tea,newbie green tea brewing question mostly drink black tea recently try start drinking green tea brew home seogwang joongjakseogwang flush jeju tea korea description tea purchase grassy low astringency ive trouble get flavour think result use water hot perhaps brewing long dont really method per se make tea boil water kettle steep tea mug min go day anything specific might make well cup green tea home without gaiwan,660,128
Looking for caffeine free tea similar to green tea,"Hi there! I've been enjoying loose leaf tea for a bit now though I'm certainly no expert, and I've found that I really like simple green and white teas.

I've been ordering a lot from Adagio as recommended by this subreddit and I've been really happy with the green and white teas I've gotten there.

In particular I like the following teas a lot:

* [https://www.adagio.com/green/dragonwell.html](https://www.adagio.com/green/dragonwell.html)
* [https://www.adagio.com/green/hunan\_gold.html](https://www.adagio.com/green/hunan_gold.html)
* [https://www.adagio.com/white/silver\_needle.html](https://www.adagio.com/white/silver_needle.html)

Not fully sure how to describe the taste, so I apologize, but I guess it's sort of like the green tea you usually get in bags from big brands in the supermarket, just better tasting.

I was wondering if it's possible I find something like those teas, with that subtle taste but with no caffeine.

I want something I can drink all day without worrying haha

I really appreciate the help!","Looking for caffeine free tea similar to green tea Hi there! I've been enjoying loose leaf tea for a bit now though I'm certainly no expert, and I've found that I really like simple green and white teas.

I tried Hot Bubble Tea...,"... It was a bad experience.

I thought I did it right, I ordered original black tea with tapioca bubbles. Apparently one of the most ideal combination for hot bubble tea.

The milk tea was quite good, I usually drink it plain, and even though it felt closer to hot chocolate, I enjoyed it.

The bubbles, though, ruined it. There was nothing bubbly about it, like the enjoyable fruity pop from the cold ones. It was a soft, sticky substance that I ended up swallowing whole, dreading each one. I attempted chewing it and it's just gross.

I don't know how I'm supposed to eat/drink that, I checked a guide beforehand. Meh.

Did I do anything wrong?

I liked my last experience with lemon tea and apple bubbles... Even though it's not technically tea, I enjoyed it a lot.","I tried Hot Bubble Tea... ... It was a bad experience.

Budget loose leaf recommendations?,"Hi, all!

I haven’t drank/made loose leaf in ages, but the other day I bought a lapsang souchong from Taylor’s of Harrogate and remembered how much I enjoy making and drinking it. 

What are some decent/entry level online sources for loose leaf tea?
I tend to brew western-style, though at some point I would be interested in getting a cheap gaiwan and taking it for a spin. At this point, I’d prefer to buy from the more budget end of the spectrum—a cheaper daily variety of teas. I’ll probably initially buy greens at my local Asian grocery, but was curious as to other possible sources (there’s not a local tea shop for hours, alas). 

What I like: Gunpowder green, Darjeeling, oolong, your basic black blends, jasmine green, lapsang souchong—stronger flavors in general. Would love to eventually experiment with more subtle flavors, but I realize that a budget buy might not have that sort of thing. 

What I dislike: Not a huge fan of white teas! Probably good because they’re more expensive","Budget loose leaf recommendations? Hi, all!
